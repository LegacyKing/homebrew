Spells - when required by companions


Things that shouldn't be housed here
Abilities - these are class and race specific (exception is shared abilities for companions)
Kits - these are once again specific to races
Spells - Unless shared by companions these should remain with their respective books
Feats - Unless we have duplicates in the supplements we should be able to keep these with their respective books
Races - Unless later supplements cause conflicts, then we move the affected races to the core and use the newest material (Racial Traits and the like)

### Please Update this list of Books we have in Core ###
