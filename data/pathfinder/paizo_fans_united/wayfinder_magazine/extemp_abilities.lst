Armor Proficiency	KEY:Armor Proficiency ~ Extempresario		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DEFINE:ExtempresarioArmorProficiencyLVL|0										DESC:You can cast Extempresario spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a Extempresario wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass Extempresario still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.|PREVARGTEQ:ExtempresarioArmorProficiencyLVL,1|PREVARLT:ExtempresarioArmorProficiencyLVL,7	DESC:You can cast Extempresario spells while wearing light or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance.

Arcane Pool		KEY:Arcane Pool ~ Extempresario			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DEFINE:ExtempresarioArcanePoolLVL|0	DEFINE:ExtempresarioArcanePool|0	DEFINE:ExtempresarioArcanePoolBonus|0	DESC:You have a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that you draw upon to fuel your powers and enhance your weapon. This arcane pool has %1 points. The pool refreshes once per day when you prepare your spells. You can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon you are holding a +%2 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.|ExtempresarioArcanePool|ExtempresarioArcanePoolBonus	DESC:These bonuses can be also used to add any of the following weapon properties: Dancing, Flaming, Flaming Burst, Frost, Icy Burst, Keen, Shock, Shocking Burst, Speed, or Vorpal. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time you use this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than you. You can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If you use this ability again, the first use immediately ends.|PREVARGTEQ:ExtempresarioArcanePoolLVL,5				BONUS:VAR|ExtempresarioArcanePool|max(floor(ExtempresarioArcanePoolLVL/2),1)+CHA	BONUS:VAR|ExtempresarioArcanePoolBonus|min(1+((ExtempresarioArcanePoolLVL-1)/4),5)	SOURCEPAGE:p.9		ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|ExtempresarioArcanePool	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per Day	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(%1/day)|ExtempresarioArcanePool
Cantrips		KEY:Cantrips ~ Extempresario			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																				DESC:Like a standard magus, an extempresario learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other extempresario spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. This replaces the standard magus cantrips ability.
Spell Combat		KEY:Spell Combat ~ Extempresario		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Internal.ClassAbility		VISIBLE:NO																																																																																																																																																																																																				ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Spell Combat Output|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Improved Spell Combat ~ Extempresario,Greater Spell Combat ~ Extempresario,True Extempresario ~ Extempresario
Spell Combat		KEY:Spell Combat Output				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:You can cast spells and wield your weapons at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the offhand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic components), while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon at a -2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the Extempresario spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action  (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If you cast this spell defensively, you can decide to take an additional penalty on your attack rolls, up to your Charisma bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on your concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if you have more than one attack, you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.
Spellstrike		KEY:Spellstrike ~ Extempresario			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:Whenever you cast a spell with a range of "touch" from the Extempresario spell list, you can deliver the spell through any weapon you are wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, a Extempresario can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If you make this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the weapon's critical range (20, 19-20, or 18-20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals x2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.
Extempresario Arcana	KEY:Extempresario Arcana ~ Extempresario	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Internal.ClassAbility		VISIBLE:NO	DEFINE:ExtempresarioArcanaLVL|0																																																																																																																																																																																																			BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Extempresario Arcana|ExtempresarioArcanaLVL/3

Spell Reserves		KEY:Spell Reserves Output			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 4th level, the extempresario may use a swift action to prepare an extempresario spell that she knows as a reserve spell by expending a number of points from her arcane pool equal to the spell’s level (minimum 1). Casting a reserve spell does not count against the extempresario’s spells per day. The extempresario may also apply any applicable metamagic or similar arcana that duplicates the effect of a metamagic feat that she knows to this spell by expending an additional number points from her of arcane pool equal to the sum of the spell’s modified spell level from each metamagic arcana plus 1 point per metamagic arcana added. She cannot spend more additional points from her arcane pool on spell reserves than ½ her extempresario level. She may retain any prepared reserve spells indefinitely, but the arcane pool points spent count against her daily limit until either the reserve spell is cast or the extempresario next rests. This replaces spell recall.
Knowledge Pool		KEY:Knowledge Pool ~ Extempresario		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 7th level, when an extempresario rests, she can expend a number of points from her arcane pool up to her Charisma bonus to temporarily add additional spells known, chosen from the standard magus spell list. Adding a spell to the extempresario’s spells known for the day costs a number of points from her arcane pool equal to the spell level. For each point expended, she gains 1 spell level worth of spells. For example, if she spends 4 points, she may chose two 2nd level spells, or one 1st level and one 3rd level spell. She cannot use knowledge pool to gain a higher level spell than she can cast. A cantrip is treated as 1 spell level. She treats these temporary spells as if they were spells she normally knows, retaining them until she next rests, when they are forgotten. She casts these temporary spells as any other spell known, including casting them using her spell reserves ability. However, she may not expend addition points to add metamagic arcana effects to these temporarily known spells. This replaces the standard knowledge pool.

This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the offhand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you must have one hand free, while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon at a -2 penalty. You can also cast any spell from the Extempresario spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action. When using the spell combat ability, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration check. If you cast this spell defensively, you can decide to take an additional penalty on your attack rolls, up to your Charisma bonus, and add the same amount as an additional circumstance bonus to your concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if you have more than one attack, you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks. You must have one hand free to use this ability, even if the spell being cast does not contain somatic components.
Fighter Training	KEY:Fighter Training ~ Extempresario		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DEFINE:ExtempresarioFighterTrainingLVL|0										DESC:You count 1/2 your total Extempresario level as your fighter level for the purpose of qualifying for feats.

Improved Spell Reserves	KEY:Improved Spell Reserves Output		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 11th level, the extempresario’s ability to recall spells using her arcane pool becomes more efficient. Whenever she prepares a spell with spell reserves, she expends a number of points from her arcane pool equal to ½ the spell’s total level (minimum 1), including any extra effective spell levels added by each metamagic arcana. The extempresario still adds 1 additional arcane point per every metamagic arcana added. This replaces improved spell recall.

Greater Spell Combat	KEY:Greater Spell Combat Output			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:You can seamlessly cast spells and wield your weapons effectively at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the offhand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you must have one hand free, while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon at a -2 penalty. You can also cast any spell from the Extempresario spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action.  When using the spell combat ability, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration check. If you cast this spell defensively, you can decide to take an additional penalty on your attack rolls, up to your Charisma bonus, and add double the same amount as an additional circumstance bonus to your concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if you have more than one attack, you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks. You must have one hand free to use this ability, even if the spell being cast does not contain somatic components.
Counterstrike		KEY:Counterstrike ~ Extempresario		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:Whenever an enemy within your reach successfully casts a spell defensively, that enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from you after the spell is complete. This attack of opportunity cannot disrupt the spell.
Greater Spell Access	KEY:Greater Spell Access ~ Extempresario	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:You gain access to an expanded spell list. You learn and place 14 spells from the wizard's spell list into your spellbook as Extempresario spells of their wizard level. You gain two of each of the following wizard spells not on the Extempresario spell list: 0-level, 1st-level, 2nd-level, 3rd-level, 4th-level, 5th-level, and 6th-level. You can ignore the somatic component of these spells, casting them without the normal chance of spell failure.
True Extempresario	KEY:True Extempresario ~ Extempresario		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:You are a master of spells and combat. You can cast spells and wield your weapons effectively at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the offhand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you must have one hand free, while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon without penalty. You can also cast any spell with a casting time of 1 standard action from the Extempresario spell list. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks if you have more than one attack. You don not need to make a concentration check to cast the spell defensively. You must have one hand free to use this ability, even if the spell being cast does not contain somatic components. Whenever you use spell combat and your spell targets the same creature as your melee attacks, you can choose to either increase the DC to resist the spell by +2, grant yourself a +2 circumstance bonus on any checks made to overcome spell resistance, or grant yourself a +2 circumstance bonus on all attack rolls made against the target during your turn.
