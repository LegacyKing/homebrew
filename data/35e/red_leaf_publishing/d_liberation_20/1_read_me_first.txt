This set is incomplete, it was used to create a couple of characters before switching to the immensely versatile Classless system published by DISTANT HORIZONS GAMES - Eclipse Classless d20 Point Buy: Codex Persona, by Paul Melroy and Patrick Bryant.

There is no further development planned with this set. Feel free to use it as subject study or finish it.

It can't be included in PCGen as the Publisher went out of business several years ago.

Cheers,
