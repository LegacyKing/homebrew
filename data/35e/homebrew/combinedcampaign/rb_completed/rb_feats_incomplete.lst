Size Doesn'T Matter	TYPE:General
Prerequisite: Combat Expertise, Power Attack, character level 10th.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack, as long as it does not cause a larger opponent to actually be treated as a size category smaller than yours.
Designer's Notes: This feat effectively grants a +4 circumstantial bonus to opposed special attacks, but usually only against some of the more powerful monsters out there.  The reason why this feat does not merely grant an additional +4 bonus (unnamed and therefore universal) to such special attacks, is because the designer's intention was to help PCs actually have a fighting chance to grapple or trip monsters, without making them ridiculously lethal against humanoid NPCs or in PvP play.  By instead eliminating the circumstantial +4 size bonuses of larger opponents, this prevents PCs from feeling helpless in some situations (fighting a dragon), without accidentally making them over-powered in other situations (fighting a blackguard).

You can't add the bonus from Power Attack to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with unarmed strikes or natural weapon attacks), even though the penalty on attack rolls still applies. (Normally, you treat a double weapon as a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a double weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of it in a round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.)
