   As companions, the Dragoncats use Esteria’s base Skills, Saves, BAB, and Level whenever these exceed their natural abilities. She may communicate with them, opt to share the effects of spells and powers with them, channel powers through them at ranges of up to one mile, and store up to 10 levels of spells in each. Each of them also adds a +1 bonus to her effective Constitution (the usual +6 CP worth of abilities, plus the half-price modifier for buying attribute upgrades on Atheria). On the other hand, effects targeting them can affect her as well.

   The dragoncats have 73, 70, 68, 71, 69, and 77 HP. Unfortunately, I don’t happen to have all their names any longer.
