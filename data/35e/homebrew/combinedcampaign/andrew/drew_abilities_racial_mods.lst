Elven Trance				KEY:Elven Racial ~ Trance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	DESC:Elves do not sleep, as members of the other common races do. Instead, an elf meditates in a deep trance for 4 hours a day. An elf resting in this fashion gains the same beenfit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. While meditating, an elf dreams, though these dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.
