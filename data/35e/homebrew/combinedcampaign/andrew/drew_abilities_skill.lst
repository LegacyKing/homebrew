Psychic (Apport)			KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Apport			SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_A		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:You can teleport a target as a standard action. Distance is not a factor. The base DC is 10, modified by the object's mass, its familiarity to you, and the familiarity of the destination. For example, apporting a 10-pound object (DC +0) that is in your line of sight (DC +0) to a destination in your line of sight (DC +0), such as apporting an opponent's weapon into your hand, is DC 10. Apporting the same object in your line of sight to a somewhat familiar destination (DC +15) is DC 25. If the object is out of your line of sight and only somewhat familiar, the DC is increased to 40, and so forth. Generally, the DC of apporting an adult human is +10 for mass, plus familia rity modifiers. Unwilling creatures get a Reflex saving throw to resist apportation of themselves or any object they are wearing, carrying, or holding. A successful save means there is no effect. You must apport an entire object, not simply part of it, although unattached materials may be left behind. For example, you can apport a rope or p air of manacles without affecting the creature bound by them. Targets cannot be apported inside other solid objects: attempts to do so Simply fail, although the Gamemaster may permit the apported target to appear in the nearest open space to the desired destination. &nl; [Special] You can take 10 on an Apport check, but you can't take 20.&nl; [Time] Apport is a standard action.&nl; [Strain] 1 plus familiarity and mass modifiers.																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Psychic (Blink Teleport)	KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Blink Teleport		SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_B		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:No Check. You can rapidly "blink" in and out of an area, appearing and disappearing from reality. Attacks have a 50%% miss chance against you while you are blinking and you suffer only half damage from area attacks. You strike as an invisible creature, with a +2 attack bonus and deny your target his Dexterity bonus to AC. &nl; Time - Blink Teleport is a move action. You can blink for a number of rounds equal to half your Blink Teleport ranks (rounded up). To continue blinking, take an additional move action and pay the strain cost for the skill again.&nl; Strain 3																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Psychic (Empathy)			KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Empathy			SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_E		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:An Empathy check allows you to determine the emotional state of the subject. The target gets to make a Will save to resist your attempt. Whether you succeed or fail, the subject does not know that you are reading his emotions. If the target's save fails, you get a general idea of his emotions and mood. This grants you a psychic bonus on the next skill check you make against the subject within the next 10 rounds (1 minute) using any of the following interaction skills - Bluff, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Perform, or Sense Motive. &nl; Special - You can take 10 when making an Empathy check but you can't take 20. Time - Empathy is a free action. The bonus lasts 10 rounds (1 minute) or until you make an interaction skill check against the target. &nl; Strain 1 &nl; [Up to 4 / +1]&nl; [5-14 / +2]&nl; [15-24 /+3]&nl; [25-34 / +4]&nl; [35+ / +5]																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Psychic (Mental Contact)	KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Mental Contact		SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_M		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:You can make psychic contact with another mind. The base DC is 10, modified by fami liarity. If the subject has a Psychic Shield, you have to make a Mental Contact check to overcome it. An unwilling subject gets a Will saving throw to avoid contact. If the save is successful, no contact is made. If you do not want the subject to know that you are making mental contact, you can make a Mental Contact check against the subject's Wisdom, Psychic Sense, or Psychic Shield check (whichever has the highest bonus). If you win, the subject is unaware of your attempt. If the subject wins, he is aware of your attempt (whether you succeed or fail). While you are in mental contact with another creature, the two of you can communicate at the rate of normal speech, "hearing" each other's transmitted thoughts. You can also send a single visual image each round instead of speaking. Both you and the subject can choose to lie or omit information; you're "speaking" to each other telepathically, not reading each other's thoughts. Mental contact is two-way, meaning that you are in mental contact with the subject for purposes of his psychic skills and vice versa. If a friendly mental contact turns hostile, the subject can make a Will saving throw or Psychic Shield check to break contact. Once the subject has failed a Will save to eject the intruder from his mind, he can't break the contact. The intruder is in his mind until he chooses to break contact or some outside force interferes, such as a distraction or another psychic skill such as Psychic Shield or Psychic Static. If your mental contact is broken, any other psychic skills you are maintaining that require mental contact are also broken.																					SOURCEPAGE:p.31

Psychic (Psychic Shield)	KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Psychic Shield		SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_Ps	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:When you are the target of any psychic skill that grants a Will saving throw, you can make a Psychic Shield skill check instead. The attacker must make a skill check using the attacking psychic skill. If your check result is higher, the attack fails. If the attacker's result is higher, the psychic skill affects you normally, but you still get a normal saving throw. You may choose to voluntarily lower your Psychic Shield as a free action (and can raise it again as a free action as well). Otherwise, your shield is assumed to always be active, even if you are unconscious or sleeping.

Psychic (Telekinesis)		KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Telekinesis		SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_T		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:A Telekinesis check allows you to move an object in your line of sight.
