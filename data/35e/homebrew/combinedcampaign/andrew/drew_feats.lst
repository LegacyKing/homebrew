SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.73			BENEFIT:You can take 10 on caster level checks (as if the caster level check was a skill check).
Arcane Preparation									CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																																															PRETEXT:Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.																																DESC:You can prepare an arcane spell ahead of time, just as a wizard does.																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.73			BENEFIT:Each day, you can use one or more of your spell slots to prepare spells you know, usually for the purpose of applying a metamagic feat to the spellbut without an increase in its casting time. Preparing a spell uses a spell slot of the appropriate level, and once prepared, that slot cant be used for anything else until the prepared spell is cast.
Battle Caster										CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																																															PRETEXT:Ability to ignore arcane spell failure chance from armor.																															DESC:Building on your existing training allows you to avoid the chance of arcane spell failure when you wear armor heavier than normal.																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.75			BENEFIT:You are able to wear armor one category heavier than you can normally wear while still avoiding the chance of arcane spell failure. For example, if you have the ability to normally wear light armor without incurring a chance of spell failure, you can wear medium armor and continue to cast spells as normal. This ability does not extend to shields, nor does it apply to spells gained from spellcasting classes other than the class that provides the ability to cast arcane spells while in armor.
Black Lore of Moil									CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic																					PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=7		PREFEAT:1,Spell Focus (Necromancy)																																																																																																							DESC:Your study of the sinister knowledge and spellcasting techniques of the long-dead Nightlords of Moil makes your necromancy spells especially potent.																																																																																																				ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																																																																																												SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.75			BENEFIT:Any necromancy spell you cast can be cast instead as a Moilian spell, dealing an extra 1d6 points of negative energy damage +1d6 per two spell levels (+1d6 for 1st-level spells, +2d6 for 2nd- or 3rd-level spells, and so on). If the spell normally allows a saving throw, the target takes half the negative energy damage on a successful save, regardless of the outcome of the save on the spells normal effect. In addition to its normal spell components, a Moilian spell requires the creation and expenditure of a Moilian runebonea small human bone (often a finger bone) scribed with carefully prepared arcane markings. Only a character trained in the Black Lore of Moil knows the secrets of creating a runebone, which takes 1 hour to craft and requires special inks and powders costing 25 gp per die of negative energy damage to be generated. For example, a runebone capable of adding 3d6 points of negative energy damage to a spell costs 75 gp to craft. While the maximum negative energy damage dealt by a Moilian spell is based on the spells level, the actual damage is limited by the runebone. For example, if a sorcerer casts finger of death (a 7th-level spell, so normally +4d6) with a 75-gp (3d6) runebone, the spell deals only 3d6 points of additional negative energy damage.
Born of the Three Thunders								CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic																											PREFEAT:1,Energy Substitution (Electricity)																																												PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Nature)=4																																																				DESC:You have learned to marry the power of lightning and thunder in your electricity and sonic spells.																																																																																																												ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																																																																																												SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.76			BENEFIT:When you cast a spell with either the electricity descriptor or the sonic descriptor that deals hit point damage, you can declare that spell to be a spell of the three thunders, with half its damage dealt as electricity damage and half dealt as sonic damage. In addition, the spell concludes with a mighty thunderclap that stuns all creatures that take damage from the spell for 1 round unless they succeed on a Fortitude save, then knocks stunned creatures prone unless they succeed on a Refl ex save (both saves at the same DC as the base spell). Channeling the three thunders is costly, though, and you are automatically dazed for 1 round after doing so.
Chain Spell											CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic																											PREFEAT:1,TYPE=Metamagic																																																																																																								DESC:You can cast spells that arc to other targets in addition to the primary target.																																																																																																															ADDSPELLLEVEL:3																																																																																												SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.76			BENEFIT:Any spell that specifi es a single target and has a range greater than touch can be chained so as to affect that primary target normally, then arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Each arc affects one secondary target chosen by you, all of which must be within 30 feet of the primary target, and none of which can be affected more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum. If the chained spell deals damage, the secondary targets each take half as much damage as the primary target (rounded down) and can attempt Refl ex saving throws for half damage (whether the spell allows the original target a save or not). For spells that dont deal damage, the save DCs against arcing effects are reduced by 4. For example, if a 10th-level wizard normally casts cause fear at DC 14, a chained cause fear could target a goblin chieftain at DC 14 and up to ten of his nearby guards at DC 10.
Collegiate Wizard										CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																						PRECLASS:1,Wizard=1																									PRELEVEL:MAX=1																																							PRESTAT:1,INT=13																																											DESC:You have undergone extensive training in a formal school for wizards.

ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																																																																																												SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.76			BENEFIT:While the two of you are adjacent, you and another spellcaster with the Cooperative Spell feat can simultaneously cast the same spell at the same time in the round. Add +2 to the save DC of cooperatively cast spells and +1 to caster level checks to beat the targets spell resistance (if any), using the higher base DC and level check of either caster.
Craft Contingent Spell									CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.ItemCreation																				PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=11																																																																																																														DESC:You know how to attach semipermanent spells to a creature and set them to activate under certain conditions.																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.77			BENEFIT:You can make contingent any spell that you know. Crafting a contingent spell takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price (spell level  caster level  100 gp). To craft a contingent spell, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half the base price. Some spells incur extra costs in material components or XP (as noted in their descriptions), which must be paid when the contingent spell is created.
Delay Spell											CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic																											PREFEAT:1,TYPE=Metamagic																																																																																																								DESC:You can cast spells that take effect after a short delay of your choosing.																																																																																																																ADDSPELLLEVEL:3																																																																																												SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.77			BENEFIT:When casting a spell, you set a delay of 1 to 5 rounds before it takes effect. The delay time cannot be changed once set; the spell activates just before your turn on the round you designate. Only area, personal, and touch spells can be affected by this feat. Any decisions you would make about the spell (including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area) are decided when the spell is cast, with any of its effects (including damage and saving throws) decided when the spell triggers. If conditions change during the delay period in ways that would make the spell impossible to cast (the target you designate moves beyond the spells range, for example), the spell fails. During the delay period, a delayed spell can be dispelled normally, and it can be detected in the area or on the target (as applicable).
Double Wand Wielder									CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																												PREFEAT:2,Craft Wand,Two Weapon Fighting																																																																																																						DESC:You can activate two wands at the same time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.77			BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you can wield a wand in each hand (if you have both hands free), with one wand designated as your primary wand and the other your secondary wand. Each use of the secondary wand expends 2 charges from it instead of 1.

MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SCHOOLS|FEAT=Energy Substitution	SELECT:1																																																																																																																													SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.78			BENEFIT:Choose one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) that matches an energy type you have selected for substitution via the Energy Substitution feat. You can then modify any spell with an energy descriptor by adding an equal amount of the chosen type of energy to the spells normal effects. The altered spell works normally in all respects except for the type and amount of damage dealt, with each type of energy counting separately toward the spells damage cap. Thus, an acid fireball cast at 6th level deals 6d6 points of fi re damage and 6d6 points of acid damage (rolled separately), while the same acid fi reball cast at 10th level or higher deals 10d6 points of fi re damage and 10d6 points of acid damage. Even opposed types of energy (such as fire and cold) can be combined using this feat.

MULT:YES	CHOOSE:STRING|Acid|Cold|Electricity|Fire																																	ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																																																																									SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.79			BENEFIT:Choose one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). You can then modify any spell with an energy descriptor to use the chosen type of energy instead. An energy substituted spell uses a spell slot of the spells normal level. The spells descriptor changes to the new energy typefor example, a fireball composed of cold energy is an evocation [cold] spell.
Explosive Spell										CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic																																																																																																																																							DESC:You can cast spells that blast creatures off their feet.																																																																																																																			ADDSPELLLEVEL:2																																																																																												SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.79			BENEFIT:On a failed Reflex save, an explosive spell ejects any creature caught in its area, sending it to a location outside the nearest edge of that area, dealing additional damage and further knocking creatures prone.

For instance, an 8th-level warmage with 18 Intelligence gets a +7 bonus on the damage dealt by any spell that deals hit point damage.

For example, a 4th-level sorcerer (maximum spell level 2nd) gains either an extra 0-level or 1st level slot, and is able to cast any spell he knows of the chosen level one more time each day. Likewise, a 4th-level wizard can prepare any extra 0-level or 1st-level spell he knows. Once selected, the extra spell slot never changes level.

Thus, a 4th-level sorcerer (maximum spell level 2nd) gains a new 0-level or 1st-level spell known with which to expand her repertoire. For classes such as wizard that have more options for learning spells, Extra Spell is generally used to learn a specifi c spell that the character lacks access to and would be unable to research.

The spells level does not change, nor does the choice of spell and modification once chosen.

You do not need to have the metamagic feat that you apply to the spell.

Half the damage dealt by an uttercold spell is cold damage, and the other half is negative energy damage. The spells saving throw remains unchanged, but creatures can apply cold resistance or immunity to cold only to the cold portion of the damage. An undead creature can be healed by the negative energy damage of an uttercold spell, though if it doesnt have resistance to cold, the effects of damage and healing cancel each other out.

You can then modify any spell with the chosen descriptor to deal nonlethal damage instead of normal energy damage. The nonlethal spell works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealtfor example, a nonlethal fi reball has the same range and area, but since it deals nonlethal damage instead of energy damage, it will not damage objects or set fi re to combustibles in the area.
#Obtain Familiar											CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																						PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Arcane=3																																																PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Arcana)=4																																																					DESC:You gain a familiar.																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.81			BENEFIT:You can obtain a familiar in the same manner as a sorcerer or wizard (see the sorcerer class description and the accompanying sidebar, page 52 of the Players Handbook). As with a sorcerer or wizard, obtaining a familiar takes 24 hours and uses up magic materials worth 100 gp.

Spells of instantaneous duration cannot be affected by this feat, nor can spells whose effects are discharged. You dont need to maintain concentration on persistent detect spells (such as detect magic or detect thoughts) for you to be aware of the mere presence or absence of the subject detected, but gaining additional information requires concentration as normal.

In addition, when facing a creature protected by mirror image, you can immediately pick out the real creature from its figments. Your ability to ignore the miss chance granted by magical concealment doesnt grant you any ability to ignore nonmagical concealment (so you would still have a 20%% miss chance against an invisible creature hiding in fog, for example).

You gain an extra 2nd-level spell slot that must be used initially to cast only the chosen spell. Until your level is high enough to allow you to cast 2nd-level spells, you must succeed on a DC 8 caster level check to successfully cast this spell; if you fail, the spell is miscast to no effect. Your caster level with the chosen spell is your normal caster level, even if this level is insufficient to cast the spell under normal circumstances. When you become able to cast 2nd-level spells, you lose the benefit described above but retain the extra 2nd-level spell slot, which you can use to prepare or spontaneously cast a spell of 2nd level or lower as you normally would. Finally, you gain a +2 bonus on all Spellcraft checks.

This extra damage applies only to the fi rst successful attack of spells that create multiple rays or missiles, or to the fi rst round of damage for spells that deal damage over multiple rounds on a single successful attack (such as Melfs acid arrow). Because you must be able to strike precisely, the extra damage applies only to targets within 30 feet. Only spells that deal hit point damage can be affected by this feat.

For example, by expending 2 charges at once, a wand of magic missile (created at caster level 3rd) can be used at caster level 5th, firing three missiles instead of two. You can expend only 1 extra charge at a time using this feat.

No matter where you might have moved in the previous round, the second spell originates from the same location and affects the same area as the original spell. If the original spell designates a ranged target, the repeated spell affects the same target if it is within 30 feet of its original position; otherwise, the second spell fails. Touch range spells cannot be affected by this feat.

The sculpted spell works normally in all respects except for its shape. For example, a lightning bolt whose area is changed to a ball deals the same amount of damage, but affects a 20-foot-radius spread.

Touch Spell Specialization								CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																						PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=4		PREFEAT:1,Weapon Focus (Touch Spell)																																																																																																						DESC:You deal extra damage with touch spells.																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.83			BENEFIT:Damage-dealing spells that require a melee touch attack roll gain a +2 bonus on the damage they deal. This extra damage applies only to the fi rst successful attack of spells that allow multiple touch attacks (such as chill touch). Only spells that deal hit point damage can be affected by this feat.
Transdimensional Spell									CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic																																																																																																																																							DESC:You can cast spells that affect targets lurking in coexistent planes and extradimensional spaces whose entrances fall within the spells area.																																																																																																					ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																																																																																												SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.84			BENEFIT:A transdimensional spell has its full normal effect on incorporeal creatures, creatures on the Ethereal Plane or the Plane of Shadow, and creatures within an extradimensional space in the spells area. Such creatures include ethereal creatures, creatures that are blinking or shadow walking, manifested ghosts, and creatures within the extradimensional space of a rope trick, portable hole, or familiar pocket (see page 106). You must be able to perceive a creature to target it with a transdimensional spell, but you do not need to perceive a creature to catch it in the area of a burst, cone, emanation, or spread.
Twin Spell											CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic																											PREFEAT:1,TYPE=Metamagic																																																																																																								DESC:You can simultaneously cast a single spell twice.																																																																																																																				ADDSPELLLEVEL:4																																																																																												SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.84			BENEFIT:Casting a twinned spell causes the spell to take effect twice in the same area or on the same target simultaneously. Any variable characteristics (including attack rolls) or decisions you would make about the spell (including target and area), are applied to both spells, with affected creatures receiving all the effects of each spell individually (including getting two saving throws if applicable). A spell whose effects wouldnt stack if it was cast twice under normal circumstances will create redundant effects if successfully twinned (see Combining Magical Effects, page 171 of the Players Handbook). For example, a twinned charm person doesnt create a more potent or long-lasting effect, but any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts in order to free the target from the charm. As with other metamagic feats, twinning a spell does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling, so a single successful counterspell negates both instances of a twinned spell.
Wand Strike											CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																															PRESKILL:1,Use Magic Device=4																																																					DESC:You can channel the magical energy of a wand through your melee attacks.																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.84			BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack with a wand, expending one charge to deal 1d6 points of damage to the creature struck. You apply no extra damage to this attack regardless of its source (including sneak attack, favored enemy, and smite bonuses), but you can activate the wand as part of the attack. If the spell cast from the wand is a ray or a targeted spell, the creature struck is the spells target (with ray spells hitting automatically). If the spell affects an area or creates a spread, you can designate the spells point of origin at any grid intersection point of the creatures space (but doing so might put you in the affected area). Spells with an effect that does not cover an area (such as the various summon monster spells) cannot be used with a wandstrike attack.

Draconic Breath										CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Draconic																											PREFEAT:1,Draconic Heritage																																																																																																								DESC:You can convert your arcane spells into a breath weapon.																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.77			BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can change arcane spell energy into a breath weapon of your draconic heritage energy type. The breath weapon is a 30-foot cone (fi re or cold) or a 60-foot line (acid or electricity) that deals 2d6 points of damage per level of the spell that you expended to create the effect. Any creature in the area can make a Reflex save (DC 10 + level of the spell used + your Cha modifi er) for half damage. This is a supernatural ability.
Draconic Claw										CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Draconic																											PREFEAT:1,Draconic Heritage																																																																																																								DESC:You develop the natural weapons of your draconic ancestors.																																																																																					TEMPLATE:CHOOSE:Claw (Fine)|Claw (Diminutive)|Claw (Tiny)|Claw (Small)|Claw (Medium)|Claw (Large)|Claw (Huge)|Claw (Gargantuan)|Claw (Colossal)																																																																																																					SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.77			BENEFIT:You gain claws. You can make a natural attack with your claw, dealing damage based on your size (Small 1d4, Medium 1d6, Large 1d8). In any round when you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 standard action, you can make a single claw attack as a swift action (see page 86) against an opponent you threaten.
Draconic Flight										CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Draconic																											PREFEAT:1,Draconic Heritage																																																																																																								DESC:The secret of draconic flight is revealed to you, granting you the ability to fly occasionally.																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCELONG:Complete Arcane		SOURCESHORT:cmparc	SOURCEPAGE:p.77			BENEFIT:After you cast an arcane spell with a casting time of 1 standard action, you gain a fly speed equal to 10 feet per level of the spell you just cast for the remainder of your turn.

The effect is negated by a Will save (DC 10 + level of the spell cast + your Cha modifier).
