###Block: THE PRACTICAL ENCHANTER
SOURCELONG:The Practical Enchanter	SOURCESHORT:TPE
# Spell Name					Clear Description	Description
Personal Haste.MOD				DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You move and attack more quickly than usual, gaining one extra attack at your full BAB when taking the full attack option and a +30 foot Enhancement bonus to all of your movement rates, although this may not more than double any one of them.
Inspiring Word.MOD				DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Inspiring Word provides its target with a +1 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, checks, and weapon damage. It counters, and is countered by, Doom.
Wizard's Pocket (Various).MOD			DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Wizard's Pocket creates a small extradimensional space anchored in a bag, wallet, small box, jar, pocket, or similar item. It can store up to 5 cubic feet or 50 pounds of material, whichever is less, at Caster Level 1 and twice that [the spell's maximum] at Caster Level 3. The caster may withdraw items by putting a hand into the container and thinking of the item desired. Retrieving items in this fashion is a moveequivalent action which does not provoke attacks of opportunity. No matter what the caster stores within the space, the total weight is only 1/20'th of normal, and thus never exceeds five pounds. The Wizard's Pack variant trades off the easy retrieval function in exchange for the ability to handle more weight and volume, allowing the spell to store up to 125 lbs. and roughly 20 cubic feet per caster level up to a maximum of 1500 lbs. and 240 cubic feet at caster level 12. Special modifiers include adding atmospheric life support [+1 level], putting nonliving items in the space into stasis, so they neither age nor decay [+1 level], or even putting both nonliving items and living creatures in the space into stasis [+2 levels]. Regardless of modifiers, the caster can renew the spell without needing to repack everything inside by simply by casting it again.
Void Sheathe.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Void Sheathe stores a single item weighing up to 20 pounds in a tiny dimensional pocket. The caster may end the spell as a free action at any time, at which point the item reappears in his or her hands, pocket, or wherever it was when the spell was cast.
Aura of Favor.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Calling upon the strength and wisdom of a greater power, you gain a +1 luck bonus on attack and damage rolls for every three caster levels you have [at least +1, to a maximum +6]. This bonus doesn't apply to spell damage, but does apply to both unarmed attacks and natural weapons.
Sutra.MOD						DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Sutra brings good fortune to your group. You and your each of your allies gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks.
Lightning Step.MOD				DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You may move with incredible speed and agility, traveling up to ((CASTERLEVEL*40)+400) feet in a blurring instant, carrying or picking up whatever you normally could. While you must be able to trace an open path to your destination, it may pass over water, through the air, or shove things aside along the way. If you collide with something solid during the trip, such as a door which you cannot simply shove open, you and anyone you're carrying take 4d6 damage.
Boundless Energy.MOD				DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Increases your base land speed by 90 feet and grants a +2 dodge bonus to your AC and Reflex Saves. It is otherwise identical to Personal Haste. [Gain one extra attack at your full BAB when taking the full attack option].
DHG ~ Haste.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Targets gain a +1 unnamed bonus to attacks, an extra attack at their full BAB when taking a full attack action, double their normal movement rate[s] via enhancement, and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and reflex saves - although any condition which negates their dexterity bonus to AC also negates the dodge bonuses.
DHG ~ Universal Energy Resistance.MOD	DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:This spell provides resistance to all forms of energy at once. The target gains resistance 10. This resistance increases to 20 points with a L7 caster and to 30 points with a L11 caster. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well, but only absorbs damage. The subject could still suffer side effects.

###BLOCK: Players Handbook
SOURCELONG:Player's Handbook	SOURCESHORT:PHB
# Spell Name					Clear Description	Description
Alarm.MOD						DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password [determined by you at the time of casting] does not set off the alarm. You decide at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible. [Mental Alarm] A mental alarm alerts you [and only you] so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental "ping" that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm. [Audible Alarm] An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing. Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the alarm. Alarm can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Arcane Sight.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly. You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. [Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect.] If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine [spell-like abilities register as arcane], and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use. Arcane sight can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Mage Armor.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a mage armor spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to AC. Unlike mundane armor, mage armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since mage armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor. [Focus] A piece of cured leather.
Fire Shield.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks [your choice]. Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level [maximum +15]. This damage is either cold damage [if the shield protects against fire-based attacks] or fire damage [if the shield protects against cold-based attacks]. If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch [10 feet]. The color of the flames is determined randomly [50%% chance of either color]-blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows. [Warm Shield] The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save. [Chill Shield] The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save. [Arcane Material Component] A bit of phosphorus for the warm shield; a live firefly or glowworm or the tail portions of four dead ones for the chill shield.
Mislead.MOD						DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You become invisible [as greater invisibility, a glamer], and at the same time, an illusory double of you [as major image, a figment] appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it [which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting]. You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so. The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The greater invisibility lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.
Misdirection.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras [detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, and the like]. On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of misdirection is detected as if it were the other object. [Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect.] Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic [augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, and the like].
Nondetection.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, and detect spells. Nondetection also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check [1d20 + caster level] against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level. If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself. [Material Component] A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 gp.
Shout.MOD						DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level [maximum 15d6]. An affected creature is allowed a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half, and a creature holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with a successful Reflex save. A shout spell cannot penetrate a silence spell.
Cone of Cold.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Cone of cold creates an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and extending outward in a cone. It drains heat, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level [maximum 15d6]. [Arcane Material Component] A very small crystal or glass cone.
Globe of Invulnerability (Lesser).MOD	DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the lesser globe of invulnerability. Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a targeted dispel magic spell, but not by an area dispel magic. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty. Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled. If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether lesser globe of invulnerability stops it. [Material Component] A glass or crystal bead that shatters at the expiration of the spell.
Keen Edge.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19-20, a threat range of 19-20 becomes 17-20, and a threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. [Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.] Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range [such as the keen edge spell and the Improved Critical feat] don't stack. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.
Levitate.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Levitate allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally [generally at half its base land speed]. A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1. [Focus] Either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end.
Dimension Door.MOD				DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired-whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature [carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load] or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature travelling with you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell simply fails.
Wall of Fire.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level [maximum +20] to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out. [Do not divide cold damage by 4, as normal for objects.] Wall of fire can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent wall of fire that is extinguished by cold damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength. [Arcane Material Component] A small piece of phosphorus.
Shrink Item.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You are able to shrink one nonmagical item [if it is within the size limit] to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension [to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass]. This change effectively reduces the object's size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a shrink item spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell. Shrink item can be made permanent with a permanency spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.
Rope Trick.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces ["planes"]. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells [including divinations], unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures [of any size]. Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope "disappear." In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free. Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot by 5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is present on the Material Plane, but it's invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space. Note - It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one. [Material Component] Powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment.
Sleep.MOD						DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:A sleep spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action [an application of the aid another action]. Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures. [Material Component] A pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a live cricket.
Shield.MOD						DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Shield creates an invisible, tower shield-sized mobile disk of force that hovers in front of you. It negates magic missile attacks directed at you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The shield has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance. Unlike with a normal tower shield, you can't use the shield spell for cover.
Feather Fall.MOD					DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round [equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet], and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes. The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures [including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load] or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth. You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a immediate action, allowing you to cast this spell even when it isn't your turn. This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop. Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.
Expeditious Retreat.MOD				DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. [This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.] There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance [see the Jump skill].

Regroup.MOD		DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You teleport your companions to your side. Each subject of this spell teleports to a square adjacent to you. If those squares are occupied or cannot support the teleported creatures, the creatures appear as close to you as posible, on a surface that can support them, in an unoccupied square.
Energy Surge.MOD	DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You temporarily imbue a weapon with elemental energy. When you cast this spell, specify an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). This spell is a spell of that type, and the target weapon is sheathed in that energy. If the attack is successful, it deals an extra 2d6 points of damage of the specified energy type.

# Spell Name			Clear Description	Description
Critical Strike.MOD		DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Upon uttering the ancient phrase that completes the spell, you feel the weapon in your hand drawn toward a creature standing nearby. Whenever you make a melee attack against a flanked foe or against a foe denied its Dexterity bonus, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage, your weapon's threat range is doubled [as if under the effect of keen edge], and you gain a +4 insight bonus on rolls made to confirm critical threats. The increased threat range granted by this spell doesn't stack with any other effect that increases your weapon's threat range. Creatures immune to extra damage from sneak attacks are immune to the extra damage dealt by your attacks.
Slide.MOD				DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:When you speak the word that activates the spell, the soles of your ally's feet glow yellow as he is lifted slightly off the ground. He slips five feet across the ground, into position to flank his opponent. You slide the subject creature along the ground a distance of 5 feet in any direction. [If the creature is flying or otherwise not on the ground, it moves parallel to the ground.] You can't slide the subject into a space that is occupied by an ally, an enemy, or a solid object; if you attempt to do so, the spell automatically ends. You cannot slide the subject up or down, but you can slide it over the edge of a cliff or other drop-off if you desire. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Belker Claws.MOD			DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You uncork the vial and speak the old words. The smoke issues from the bottle and wraps itself around your hand, turning it into smoke as well. With a successful touch attack, you deal 2d12 points of damage. For every three caster levels, the smoke lasts for another round [to a maximum of 4 additional rounds at 12th level], dealing another 2d12 points of damage per round. [Material Component] A small vial of smoke.
Blast of Force.MOD		DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Drawing upon magic in its purest form, you send invisible energy whistling through the air to batter your foe. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A blast of force deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d6]. In addition, a successful hit forces the subject to make a Fortitude save or be knocked prone [size and stability modifiers apply to the saving throw as if the spell were a bull rush].
Death Armor.MOD			DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You smear yourself with white paste, drawing a skull on your bare flesh. Immediately, a wreath of black flames crackles to life around you.  The black flames created by this spellinjure creatures that contact them. Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons takes 1d4 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels [maximum +10]. If the creature has spell resistance, it applies to the damage. Weapons with reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way. [Material Component] Paste made from ground bones. [Focus] An onyx worth 50 gp.
Flame Dagger.MOD			DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You evoke the spell and a blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand, ready to be used as a weapon. You create a bladelike beam that you can wield as if it were a dagger. Attacks with a flame dagger are melee touch attacks, and the blade deals 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level [to a maximum of +10]. Because the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A flame dagger can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, cloth, and so on. This spell does not function underwater. [Material Component] A candle.
Scorch.MOD				DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:A jet of roaring flame bursts from your outstretched hand, scorching any creature in its path. Scorch deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels, to a maximum of 5d8 points of damage, to each target it hits. [Focus] A red dragon's scale.
Icelance.MOD			DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You clutch the quartz in your hand, focusing the energy of the spell into a sharp spear. With a thought, you send it whistling through the air at your foe. You must succeed on a normal ranged attack to strike a target with an icelance. You gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll. If you hit, the icelance deals 6d6 points of damage to the target. Half of this damage is piercing damage; the rest is cold damage. In addition, the target must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Regardless of the result of the attack, the icelance shatters upon its first use. [Focus] A 50-gp clear quartz gemstone. Alternatively, if you are in a cold region, you can substitute 10 pounds of ice or snow for the quartz.
Mage Armor (Greater).MOD	DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:An invisible sheen of armor-shaped force surrounds you. This spell functions like mage armor [PH 249], except that it requires no material component and its tangible field of force provides a +6 armor bonus to Armor Class.
Resonating Bolt.MOD		DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Your quick movements and rapid utterances release the spell's energy, culminating in a final cry that unleashes a tremendous bolt of sonic energy from your open hand. The bolt of sonic energy deals 1d4 points of sonic damage per caster level [maximum 10d4] to each creature within its area. In addition, a resonating bolt deals full damage to objects and can easily shatter or break interposing barriers. If the bolt destroys a barrier, it can continue beyond the barrier if its range permits; otherwise, it stops.
Weapon of Impact.MOD		DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You pass your hands over the weapon, and its head glows with a blue-gold radiance. This spell makes a bludgeoning weapon have greater impact, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. If the spell is cast on sling bullets or other bludgeoning projectiles, the weapon of impact effect on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range, such as the Improved Critical feat, don't stack.
Flame Whips.MOD			DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:At the conclusion of this spell, your arms stretch into whiplike appendages and burst into flames. Your forelimbs transform into flaming whips. You gain two melee touch attacks with a 15-foot reach that each deal 6d6 points of fire damage. Attacks with these flaming whips replace any natural attacks you had with those limbs. While this spell is in effect, you cannot cast spells with material components, nor can you carry items with your forelimbs. Any items worn on your forelimbs cease functioning while the spell is active.
Orb of Force.MOD			DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:As you gather the energies of the spell, you feel against your palm a spherical weight that seems almost bonded to your skin. The sphere grows, until with a final precise movement, you release the translucent blue orb, sending it hurtling toward your intended target. You create a globe of force 3 inches across, which streaks from your palm toward your target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit the target. The orb deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level [maximum 10d6].
Resistance (Greater).MOD	DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Just as you touch the spell's subject, a feeling of peace and watchful guardianship fills your being. This spell functions like resistance [PH 272], except as noted here. You grant the subject a +3 resistance bonus on saves.
Thunderlance.MOD			DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:A faint gray shimmering force in the general shape of a staff or spear springs from your hand. When you cast this spell, you create a deadly lance of force. You can freely make a thunderlance retract or grow to any length from 1 foot to 20 feet, but it always remains a straight lance of force. This effect gives you a natural reach of 20 feet. You can use a thunderlance to make powerful melee attacks. You can wield a thunderlance in one or two hands, dealing a base 3d6 points of damage [crit 20/x3]. Instead of using your Strength modifier, you use the higher of your Intelligence modifier or Charisma modifier as a bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. If you successfully strike a target protected by any force effect of 3rd level or lower, such as a shield or mage armor spell, the thunderlance might dispel the force effect in addition to damaging the target. Make a dispel check against the level of the caster who created the effect. If you succeed, the effect is dispelled. The thunderlance remains whether you succeed or fail on this check. [Material Component] A small metal spear.
Arc of Lightning.MOD		DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Static fills the air as you complete the spell. With a gesture you create magical conductivity between two creatures, and a bolt of electricity arcs between them with a shockingly loud crackle. This bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level [maximum 15d6] to both creatures and to anything in the line between them. Both creatures must be in range, and you must be able to target them both [as if this spell had them as its targets]. Draw the line from any corner in one creature's space to any corner in the other's space. The bolt affects all squares in this line. [Arcane Material Component] Two small iron rods.
Dragonsight.MOD			DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:You cast this spell and your eyes enlarge and turn yellow and catlike, like those of a dragon. You gain the visual acuity of a dragon, including low-light vision, darkvision, and blindsense. You can see four times as well as a normal human in low-light conditions and twice as well in normal light. Your darkvision is effective out to 10 feet per caster level. You take half the normal penalties for distance on Spot checks. Your blindsense has a range of 5 feet per caster level. None of these effects stack with any low-light vision, darkvision, or blindsense you might already have. [Focus] A dragon's eye.
