Hold Spell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassFeature.Extraordinary	DEFINE:HoldSpellNumber|0	DEFINE:HoldSpellDuration|0	DESC:Once a spell has been powered, a spellmaster (unlike other spellcasters) need not cast it immediately, but can hold it for up to %1 minutes per class level. While gathering spell power, a spellmaster can hold %2 spell(s). If the spellmaster holds her maximum number of spells and finishes gathering power for an additional spell, she must immediately cast one of her held spells, or can choose to simply lose a spell with no effect.|HoldSpellNumber|HoldSpellDuration
Sense Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassFeature.Extraordinary											DESC:A spellmaster can sense magical auras and even manipulate ambient arcane energy to create magical effects. A spellmaster can sense magical auras by making a sense magic check as a full-round action. This check works similarly to a detect magic spell, except the spellmaster can examine one 10-foot cube of space or a single object or creature that she can touch or see. To make a sense magic check, you roll 1d20 and adds your spellmaster level (maximum +20) plus your Wisdom modifier. The DC depends on the power of the most potent magical aura present and the distance to the subject.
Counterspell		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassFeature.Supernatural											DESC:At 2nd level, a spellmaster's ability to manipulate arcane energy can disrupt other spellcasters, allowing her to counterspell using any spell she holds (see Hold Spell). Unlike a regular counterspell, the spellmaster must succeed on a roll of 1d20 + the level of the held spell or her spellmaster level (whichever is greater) against the opponent's caster level check in order for the attempt to succeed. Whether the attempt succeeds or fails, the held spell is lost as if cast.
Magic Savant		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassFeature.Extraordinary											DESC:At 4th level, a spellmaster's understanding of the building blocks of magic gives her an advantage when activating magic items. A spellmaster may use her Wisdom modifier in place of her Charisma modifier on Use Magic Device checks.																																																																																			BONUS:SKILL|Use Magic Device|WIS-CHA|PREMULT:2,[PREVARGTEQ:WIS,CHA],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Improved Magic Savant]

Greater Magic Savant	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassFeature.Extraordinary											DESC:A 12th-level spellmaster gains a +2 bonus to all Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks.																																																																																																							BONUS:SKILL|Knowledge (Arcana),Spellcraft,Use Magic Device|2
Dispel Magic		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassFeature.Supernatural											DESC:At 14th level, a spellmaster's ability to disrupt other spellcasters becomes good enough she can use any spell she holds as a greater dispel magic. Before making the dispel check, the spellmaster must succeed on a roll of 1d20 + the level of the held spell or her spellmaster level (whichever is greater) against the opponent's caster level check. Whether the attempt succeeds or fails, the held spell is lost as if it had been cast.
Turn Spell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassFeature.Supernatural											DESC:At 15th level, a spellmaster has a chance to defl ect hostile spells back toward an enemy. Whenever a spell has the spellmaster as a target and fails to penetrate her spell resistance, she can immediately make an opposed caster level check against the opposing spellcaster. If the spellmaster fails, she is aff ected normally. If she succeeds, she rebounds the spell back on the caster as if she herself had cast it. Th is ability only works on spells targeting the spellmaster, and does not work against area eff ect or touch spells.
Master Magic Savant	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassFeature													DESC:At 19th level, any time the spellmaster makes a Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, or Use Magic Device check, she may roll twice and take the better of the two results.
Absorb Spell		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassFeature.Supernatural											DESC:At 20th level, a spellmaster can absorb and store the energy of hostile spells. Whenever a spell has the spellmaster as a target and fails to penetrate her spell resistance, she can immediately make an opposed caster level check against the opposing spellcaster. If the spellmaster fails, she is aff ected normally. If she succeeds, however, she absorbs the spell and gathers enough power to cast the spell herself (the absorbed spell need not be on the list of spells of which she is aware). Th is ability does not work against area eff ect or touch spells, and the absorbed spell counts against the spellmaster's limit on spells held (so if the spellmaster is already at her limit, she cannot absorb any additional spells).
