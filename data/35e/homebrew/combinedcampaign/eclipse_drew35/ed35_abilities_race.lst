Disadvantage (Ageless)		KEY:Watcher ~ Disadvantage (Ageless)	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Watcher Race Feature	DESC:Aging, but Ageless: Watchers are described as having no maximum age, but also as growing slower and weaker and having their organs shrivel up and creaking when they move as they age. Given the rather self-contradictory nature of this "power", and the general unimportance of aging in most campaigns... I'm just going to leave it as a sort of a curse for their unnatural existence. Accursed/Ages into a sort of living death instead of passing on normally (-3 CP).
Disadvantage (Accursed)		KEY:Watcher ~ Disadvantage (Accursed)	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Watcher Race Feature	DESC:Accursed/base speed is 20' instead of 30' (-3 CP).
Disadvantage (Outcast)		KEY:Watcher ~ Disadvantage (Outcast)	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Watcher Race Feature	DESC:Outcast. Watchers are the spirits of dwarves who died of old age before completing some mighty task, hung around as ghosts, and were then bonded with the undamaged body of a dead gargoyle. This is rare, and weird, and smacks of unholy powers, makes them a freak of nature, and gives them a semi-devilish appearance to boot.
