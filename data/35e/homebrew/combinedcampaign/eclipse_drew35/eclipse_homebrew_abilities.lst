Privilege/Blessing of the Little Gods																	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Abilities.EclipseAbilityOutput																																																																							DESC:(3 CP) This is a ritual invocation of the spirits, asking them to watch over something. This lasts for at least a year, and often permanently - but is too subtle for game mechanics. A fallen candle may quietly snuff itself, rather then starting a fire, in a blessed house. Fields yield more, suffering less from pests and weather. Children are healthier, have fewer and milder accidents - and are far more likely to reach adulthood. Farm animals have more offspring, spinning thread snags less often, and artists are more inspired. The scale of the rite depends on the scale of the blessing; kids only take a minute, a city might take a three-day festival honoring the relevant Kami. As there are always kids, flocks, infertile couples, marriages, etc, in need of blessings, the Spirit-Touched can usually expect a welcome anywhere.

Arnis-Barang																SORTKEY:Martial_Arts_AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MartialArtsOutput																																																																									DESC:Arnis-Barang is a stick-fighting form related to Escrima, but its development has focused on the ability to do battle with creatures with natural weapons and an unpredictable anatomy, rather than with armed human opponents. With that distinction, it has gradually lost most of the lock / disarm techniques typical of Escrima to focus on swift blocks, long-range strikes, and versatile attacks.

Darkling Creature							SORTKEY:DarklingCreature_a	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DarklingCreatureTemplate.EclipseAbilityOutput	DESC:Magic can cause very strange deaths. And spirits. spirits cling to life. Every so often, when a creature is slain by shadow magic, the same power that destroys it's physical body touches it's spirit - allowing it to pass into it's bodies shadow, rather than departing for the Outer Planes. As the body decays, and it's shadow fades, most such unfortunates lose their grips. Their minds decay, their poorly-contained life-force fades away, and the power of the true darkness - never far from the Shadow Plane - enters in it's place. They rise as Shadows, mindless and formless horrors that exist but to kill and feed. A rare few, however, manage to retain their minds and their vital force. Over time they learn to draw the stuff of shadow about themselves - to re-emerge into the material world as Darklings - the spawn of shadows. At 83 CP, Darklings are roughly in the middle of +2 ECL territory - but vary drastically in effectiveness. Outside, in the daytime? Virtually none of their special abilities will work. In the shadows or at night? They're quite powerful.

Drive									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality								DESC:Immediately upon completing the Test of Valor, you gain the ability to Drive-- that is, infuse the Faerie Garb with a particular virtue you have to gain extra abilities for a short time. However, with all the bonuses, there is a powerful drawback: Anti Form. Anti Form is a state reached when you abuse the powers that Drives grant to you, and your heart is momentarily seized and consumed by darkness. The amount of time each form lasts depends on what is called a "Drive Gauge", which is a visible yellow meter on the left wristcuff of the Faerie Garb. If one were to pay enough attention, he would find that the Drive Gauge is actually based on a numeric system. When first seen, the amount the gauge shows would be equivalent to 30 points. When you Drive though, you see the gauge begin depleting, by 1 every second (6 per round, lost at the end of each action). Also, every time you attack (make an attack roll), you lose 1 point from the gauge. When the gauge drops to 0, your Drive ends. There are two ways to refill the Drive Gauge - 1. Each time you successfully deal damage to an opponent, the Drive Gauge refills by 1 point. 2. Once an hour the Drive Gauge automatically refills itself by 1 point. The Drive Gauge does not refill while you're in a Drive. Each time you Drive, your Form will reset the Drive Gauge for you to a particular amount. When that amount runs out, your Drive Gauge empties completely, and you revert to your normal form. At the same time your Form resets the Drive Gauge, it restores 3/4 of your maximum hit points. Also, while Driving, you ignore the penalties to your attack rolls and saving throws the Faerie Garb gives you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				BENEFIT:You can enter Drive Forms.

Each round of the counterspell, he makes a Spellcraft check. Any creature in range can use this check instead of their Will save against any spell that requires a will save, whichever is higher, if a creature within range of the counterspell is already under the influence of a non instantaneous magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the spell, using the Magistra's Spellcraft check. Counterspell has no effect against effects that don't allow will saves. The Magistra can keep a up the counterspell for 10 rounds.

The distraction of nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For  every 3 levels of Magistra beyond the 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability. To use the ability, a Magistra makes a perform check. His check is the DC for each affected creatures Will Save against the effect. If a creatures saving throw succeeds, the Magistra cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours.
