The feat selected must be wholly internal (for example, this cannot be used to temporarily acquire a familiar), and any other costs of the feat selected - such as equipment or preparation time - must be met normally.

Earthward			SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Neutral	CLASSES:ALL=3	PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Spell Access for Paths of Power	COMPS:V, F	CASTTIME:Special	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:Instantaneous	DESC:Earthward diverts a portion of the effects of an incoming attack into the surrounding environment. It can be invoked as a free action during any creatures turn just after the damage, and any other effects, of an attack have been determined. When invoked it will negate either up to 3d8+(min(CASTERLEVEL,15)) [+1/Level, 15 Max] points of damage or any one special effect resulting from that attack, such as poison, energy drain, or paralysis. The effect relies on an innate attunement to the energies of the natural world however, hence it cannot be used in devices, or by non-neutral or undead casters.

The Mystic Touch				SCHOOL:Illusion		CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=0		PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - The Practical Enchanter Spell Access,Professor Darian	COMPS:S	CASTTIME:One swift action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:Special									DURATION:Special						SAVEINFO:None (Harmless)	SPELLRES:No			DESC:The Mystic Touch changes how a skill appears to operate; a character with this spell might take out his lockpicks and work on a lock - or he might pull out a piece of chalk, sketch a symbol around the keyhole, and make a few mystic passes, or he might, perhaps, utter a "Word of Power". Regardless of the special effects, the only actual effect is that the user may make his or her skill check at a range of a foot or so, rather than actually touching the item in question. That's occasionally quite helpful when the item you want to manipulate is electrified, or hot, or covered with contact poison, or some such.
Manifestation of Ilium			SCHOOL:Illusion		CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1			PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - The Practical Enchanter Spell Access,Professor Darian	COMPS:S	CASTTIME:One standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Special, most often a five-foot radius maximum.			DURATION:Maximum of ten minutes per level (D).	SAVEINFO:Special			SPELLRES:Special		DESC:Manifestation of Ilium produces zero-level manipulations of light and sound. It can duplicate cantrips such as Dancing Lights, Flare, Ghost Sound, Light, and Message, or produce original effects of similar levels of power. For example, it can create a concealing shadow or a ten-by-ten section of illusory wall, disguise a face, cause the users eyes to glow brilliantly or to seem to have tiny skulls for pupils, make a voice deep and booming, imitate a megaphone, create a glowing aura about a single creature (like Faerie Fire), zap something with a "laser" (fire damage) or sonic bolt for 1d4 damage with a ranged touch attack, or create an intimidating barrier of (illusory) flames. Instantaneous effects are over and done with immediately, ongoing effects may persist for up to ten minutes per level of the caster. Saving throws usually apply when the effects directly involve an unwilling creature UNLESS a ranged attack roll is required.
Dexterous Fingers				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Bard,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard=1	PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - The Practical Enchanter Spell Access,Professor Darian	COMPS:S	CASTTIME:One swift action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature Touched.								DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)	DESC:Dexterous Fingers reduces the time required to use a skill by three rounds. If this reduces it to zero time or "less", it becomes a free action, although only one such action is permitted per round. If Dexterous Fingers is used on a continuous basis, it can reduce the time required for the long-term use of a skill by 75%%.	DESC:Iruks Chant of Lesser Dispelling. This spell adheres to the Dispel template from The Practical Enchanter, with the options of Close Range (+1 spell level) and Arcanum Minimus/Life Energy (the user must make a Fortitude check at DC 11 to avoid becoming Fatigued when casting it). It targets a single magical effect.
