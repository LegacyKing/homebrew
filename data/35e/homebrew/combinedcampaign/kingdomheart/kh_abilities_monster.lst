###Block: Large Body -----------------
# Ability Name	Category of Ability		Type				Description																																																																																																																																		Virtual Feat
Frontal Immunity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	DESC:One of the toughest types of Heartless, Large Bodies are immune to physical damage from their front half. Even the most powerful of magical weapons (including those with elemental damage) and boulders the size of houses simply bounce off, causing the Large Body no injury. Physical attacks to the head or back of a Large Body inflict normal damage, as do spells from any quadrant. However Large Bodies are so resilient that any attack against them does 3 less damage (DR 3/[none] as noted in their stat block). [Rules Note: In the interest of fair play, a Large Body's facing must always be carefully noted. Also, you may decide that instead of granting this immunity to the sidefront squares, those squares instead gain a +10 AC; or a 50%% chance of hitting the immune portion]
Full Swing		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack	DESC:The Large Body has Whirlwind Attacks as a bonus feat, without any prerequisites. In addition, if the Large Body scores a critical hit with Full Swing, the struck enemy must make a Ref Save (DC equal to the Large Body's Strength Score) or be knocked back 20 feet.																																																																																							VFEAT:Whirlwind Attack
Belly Slide		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack	DESC:The Large Body gains Improved Bull Rush and Improved Overrun as bonus feats. In addition the Large Body can Belly Slide as a full-attack action. The Large Body moves up to 40 feet, and Bull rushes and Overruns any enemy it passes during the move. When the Large Body performs a Belly Slide, it only gains 1 standard action during the next combat round.																																																																								VFEAT:Improved Bull Rush|Improved Overrun

Improved Grab - Dancer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack			DESC:Whenever the dancer hits with his slam attack he can start a free grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. He can hit any medium or smaller creature with this grab. Once successful, he can then proceed to execute the dancer grab.
#
Dancer Grab				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack			DESC:This is the signature attack for this creature. Once he has succeeded in a grapple check, the dancer can move up to his speed in any direction, and afterwards slam his opponent into the ground. For every 10 feet the dancer moved, the opponent is thrown 5 feet away from the dancer and dealt 1d6 damage. In other words, if the dancer travels 60 feet he throws his opponent 30 feet away dealing 6d6 damage (in addition to any slam and grapple damage already done). This movement doesn�t counts to determine the maximum speed a dancer can move in a round.
