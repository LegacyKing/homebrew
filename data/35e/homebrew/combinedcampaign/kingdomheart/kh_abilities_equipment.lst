Drive									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality								DESC:Immediately upon completing the Test of Valor, you gain the ability to Drive-- that is, infuse the Faerie Garb with a particular virtue you have to gain extra abilities for a short time. However, with all the bonuses, there is a powerful drawback: Anti Form. Anti Form is a state reached when you abuse the powers that Drives grant to you, and your heart is momentarily seized and consumed by darkness. The amount of time each form lasts depends on what is called a "Drive Gauge", which is a visible yellow meter on the left wristcuff of the Faerie Garb. If one were to pay enough attention, he would find that the Drive Gauge is actually based on a numeric system. When first seen, the amount the gauge shows would be equivalent to 30 points. When you Drive though, you see the gauge begin depleting, by 1 every second (6 per round, lost at the end of each action). Also, every time you attack (make an attack roll), you lose 1 point from the gauge. When the gauge drops to 0, your Drive ends. There are two ways to refill the Drive Gauge - 1. Each time you successfully deal damage to an opponent, the Drive Gauge refills by 1 point. 2. Once an hour the Drive Gauge automatically refills itself by 1 point. The Drive Gauge does not refill while you're in a Drive. Each time you Drive, your Form will reset the Drive Gauge for you to a particular amount. When that amount runs out, your Drive Gauge empties completely, and you revert to your normal form. At the same time your Form resets the Drive Gauge, it restores 3/4 of your maximum hit points. Also, while Driving, you ignore the penalties to your attack rolls and saving throws the Faerie Garb gives you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				BENEFIT:You can enter Drive Forms.

Wisdom Form								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:Once you complete the Test of Wisdom, you gain Wisdom Form. While in Wisdom Form, you float about an inch off the ground, greatly increasing your mobility. You gain a +10ft. enhancement bonus to your base land speed. You also gain a +6 bonus to Dexterity, and a +2 bonus to your Caster Level. Also, your ability to attack in melee combat changes drastically. Whenever you would normally make a melee attack while in Wisdom Form, instead you fire off a series of small energy blasts from the tip of your keyblade. For every attack you would normally gain from your BAB, you instead gain two of these small blasts. Each blast acts like a magic missile spell in every way, save that for each group of two, you must hit with a ranged touch attack to deal damage. In addition to all of that, you gain the ability to leap out of the way of an attack while magically protected, called the Air Slide (I). As a full-round action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, you may make a Jump check. You move horizontally a number of feet equal to 1/4 your Jump check result, and you are immune to all attacks that would be made against you in that round. You may only use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. You must have at least 30 points in your Drive Gauge to Drive into Wisdom Form. When you do, your Drive Gauge resets to 40 points. Each group of missile shots reduces your Gauge by 1 point, and each spell you cast reduces the gauge by 2 points, in addition to the normal reduction of the Drive Gauge.

Master Form								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:You gain Master Form upon completion of the Test of a Master. When in Master Form, you gain +2 Str and Dex, and a +1 bonus to your caster level. You gain Two-Weapon Fighting as well as the extra keyblade, just like in Valor Form. However, the extra keyblade spins telekinetically in the air, allowing you to treat it as a light weapon. You also gain the benefit of Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, and you need not meet the prerequisites. You gain a +3 insight bonus to all attack rolls you make while in Master Form. The first spell you cast each round while in Master Form is automatically quickened, and takes only a swift action to complete. While in Master Form, you gain the ability to make a second Jump check in midair as a standard action (in addition to the move action of the first Jump check). When you do, you move a number of feet equal to 1/4 the result of your Jump check in any direction. This movement, however, cannot reduce your vertical distance from the ground. When you take this second jump, reduce any damage dealt from falling by 6d6 (the equivalent of 60 ft). In order to Drive into Master Form, you must have at least 40 points in your Drive Gauge, and the gauge resets to 30.
