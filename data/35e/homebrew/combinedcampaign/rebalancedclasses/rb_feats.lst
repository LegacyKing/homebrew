New Feat Type: [Smite]
A smite feat allows you to channel the holy energy used to smite evil enemies iin new ways, expanding your options in combat.
All smite feats require the user to expend uses of their Smite Evil ability. Only one use of Smite Evil may be applied to any single attack. All Smite feats are considered Supernatural abilities, and cannot be used in any situation that such abilities would not function (such as in an antimagic field)

Celestial Lightning [Smite]
A fearsome bolt of lightning streaks from the sky and strikes your upraised weapon, arcing out in all directions and striking down surrounding foes.
Prerequisite: Holy Wrath (Electricity), Smite 3/encounter
Benefit: By expending a smite attempt as a full-round action, you raise your weapon above your head, and a lightning bolt strikes your weapon before arcing off in all directions to hit other targets. This is treated as a Chain Lightning Spell, with a caster level equal to your level in smiting classes. The weapon is considered the initial target (but takes no damage).
Note: Alternatively, the player may decide that the initial target is any other piece of equipment, or the character's body, as this is purely a flavor element.
