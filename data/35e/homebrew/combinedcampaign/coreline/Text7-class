Chainsaw Mastery 3: Once per day, you may add your Chainsaw Knight class level to one attack or damage roll with your chainsaw.

Grand Rend (Adapted from T&M Blazer): You have at long last refined the art of impaling your foes at the end of your chainsaw and lifting them off the ground as it churns up their gust. Yummy! By spending an Action Point you may drive your chainsaw into a corporeal foe. By keeping the chainsaw buried in your foe, you automatically inflict normal (non-critical) damage each round thereafter unless your opponent makes an opposed Strength check. Success causes the victim normal damage as the saw is pulled out. The victim is considered entangled when skewered by the saw. You may take no other actions aside from holding the chainsaw in place in order to keep the victim skewered. If you break your hold, your chainsaw comes free and deals normal damage as it is removed. This may be used on an incorporeal foe if your chainsaw has the “Ghost Touch” enchantment.

Greater Chainsaw Specialization: You receive an additional +2 bonus to damage rolls with your chainsaw (for a total of +4).

People want to be like them. People want to blow them to pieces. Who are you?

The Mahou Shoujo (‘Magical Girl’) is a girl gifted with magical powers to fight against the forces of Darkness (or, sometimes, for Darkness). These magical abilities are given to her by a magical creature, who has been assigned by the Powers That Be (be them the ‘actual’ powers or a magical organization) to act as her assistant and mentor. She uses her magical powers, combat prowess and dedication to fight against supernatural threats (although, sometimes, they might be more ‘down to Earth’) and assist those she encounters. Although not as common, sometimes this class is assigned to males, who would then be referred as ‘Mahou Shonen (Magical Boys)’.

On Coreline, the organization that most uses the Mahou Shoujo is the Moon Kingdom, with occasional uses from the Dark Kingdoms and at times even the government’s supernatural teams, like F-SWTI. This class obtains the more ‘standard’ set of Mahou Shoujo abilities, and as such reflects the more ‘mass produced’ (or even 'cannon fodder') variety of Magical Girls –typically selected Post-Vanishing Humans. (The BESM D20 ‘Magical Girl’ Class would represent the more powerful Fiction Magical Girl, or one who the PTBs have given more ‘favor’).

The fastest path into this Advanced Class is thru the Dedicated Hero basic class, though other paths are possible.

-REQUIREMENTS:

To become a Mahou Shoujo, the character must fulfill the following criteria:

--BAB: +2.
--Skills: Knowledge (Arcane Lore) 6 Ranks.
--(GM Optional) Special: Selected by a Magic-using Faction.

-Skill Points: 5+Int Modifier.

CLASS FEATURES:
-GUARDIAN BEAST: A Mahou Shoujo has a magical creature that serves as her assistant and mentor. This ‘Guardian Beast’ takes the form of an animal of Tiny size or smaller, for example: Cat, Bat, Hawk, Lizard, Monkey, Owl, Rat, Raven, Snake (Tiny viper), Toad or Weasel. The ‘Guardian Beast’ has the ability scores of an animal of it’s type with a +10 to Int and a +5 to Cha. In addition to it’s special qualities and racial skill bonuses, the ‘Guardian Beast’ has the ability to speak. The ‘Guardian Beast’ is otherwise treated like a 1st-Level character in one of the basic classes. For each additional level the Mahou Shoujo obtain in this class, the ‘Guardian Beast’ obtains a level in a basic class.

-ENERGY ATTACK: At 2nd Level, the Mahou Shoujo learns how to channel her inner power into an energy-based attack, dealing 2d6 points of damage. The player must decide whether this is expressed as a melee or ranged attack. If it is a melee attack, any Str-based bonus to damage applies. If it is a ranged attack, it has a range increment of 80 and a rate of fire of 1. In both instances, the attack threatens a critical on a roll of 20, for x2 damage. The player also decides what type of energy the weapon is expressed as. It can be Acid, Cold, Electricity, Fire, Sonic/Concussion, Positive or Negative energy-based (these latter two only affect Evil or Good supernaturals).
At 7th-Level, the damage caused by the Mahou Shoujo’s energy attack increases to 4d6. She also gains a secondary attack form, different in delivery and (or) energy type.

-BONUS FEATS: At 3rd, 6th and 9th Level, the Mahou Shoujo obtains a bonus feat. It must be selected from the following list, and must have all prerequisites.
Acrobatic, Alertness, Great Fortitude, Heroic Surge, Improved Damage Threshold, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Run, Toughness.

-SPRING HEELED: At 4th Level, the Mahou Shoujo gains a tremendous leaping ability. For the purpose of using the Jump skill, the Mahou Shoujo is treated as having twice her normal movement rate and having one size larger.

-INVIGORATE: At 5th Level, the Mahou Shoujo may, once per day, spend 1 action point in order to recover lost hit points. The number of lost hit points recovered is determined by rolling 1d6 per Mahou Shoujo level, restoring up to the character’s total.
At 8th Level, the Mahou Shoujo may, once per day, spend 1 action point in order to heal the hit point damage of another character. The number of hit points recovered is determined by rolling 1d6 per two Mahou Shoujo levels, restoring up the character’s total. The Mahou Shoujo may not Invigorate herself and another person on the same day.

-FLY: At 10th Level, the Mahou Shoujo may spend 1 action point to fly for 10 minutes. She can fly at a speed of 60 feet (40 feet of carrying a medium or heavy load), ascends at half speed and descends at double speed, and her maneuverability is Good. If flight is not maintained by spending an additional action point, the character will begin to descend as if she were under the ‘Feather Fall’ spell.

A new class-the (super)natural contender to the Magical Girl-and anything related to her...


It's not paranoia if they're out to get you (not, really).

THE MAGICAL GIRL HUNTER


There are those who want to be Magical Girls. And then there’s those who want to get rid of them. They are the ‘Magical Girl Hunters’.
They can come from any walk of life, with any kind of tactics. They are the conspiracy theorists who think that the Moon Kingdom is going to try and bring the Great Freeze onto Coreline. They are the people who got hurt by a Magical Girl during the 23 Hours and have declared war onto the entire genre. They could be the guys who just woke up one day hating (or fearing) everything cute. Whatever the case, they picked up the job and are now hunting the Magical Girls, and occasionally the Youmas, to make sure that neither side gets too heavy in the power scale-again, for reasons real or imagined.
Although many ‘magical girl hunters’ are simply angry men with guns, the Magical Girl Hunter (notice caps) is a veteran, having gone against the odds and survived, obtaining the knowledge to handle future hunts. In many ways, they treat the Mahou Shoujo as big game-sometimes it takes skill, sometimes it takes brawn, but it always takes guts.

Select this class if you want to be able to take on both the Magical Girls and the Youma on an even field-and not to mention being crazy enough to see the pattern in such a mind-numbing amount of clichés.

The fastest path into this Advanced Class is thru a combination of Smart and Dedicated Hero basic classes.

REQUIREMENTS
To be a Magical Girl Hunter, the character must fill the following criteria.

BAB: +3.
Skill: Knowledge (Arcane Lore) 3 ranks.
Talent: Exploit Weakness.
Special: Must have survived combat with a Mahou Shoujo or a Youma.

CLASS INFORMATION:
-Hit Die: 1d8+Con Modifier.
-Action Points: 6+one-half character level, rounded down.
-Class Skills: Craft (Electronic, Mechanical) (Int), Drive (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Investigate (Wis), Jump (Str), Knowledge (Arcane Lore, Behavioral Sciences, Earth and Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Popular Culture, Technology) (Int), Listen (Wis), Navigate (Int), Profession (Wis), Research (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis).
-Skill Points: 5+Int Modifier.

CLASS FEATURES
-MANHUNTER: When the Magical Girl Hunter sets his sights on someone, they just won't stop until finishing her. When taking a job, the Magical Girl Hunter must chose one particular subject (Magical Girl, Youma, whatever). Then he will have +1 on all rolls regarding his prey until he finishes him/her off. If handling a team, he must choose at the moment he takes the job a specific member among the members of the team.
At Level 2, the Magical Girl Hunter can choose 2 subjects. At level 8, he can choose 3 subjects. At Level 10, he can choose 4 subjects.

-WEAPON FOCUS: The Magical Girl Hunter obtains the Weapon Focus class feature, providing the benefit of the feat of the same name. The Magical Girl Hunter adds +1 to all rolls made using his selected weapon.

-PROFILE: By making a Gather Information check (DC 15) when talking to witnesses of an event, the Magical Girl Hunter compiles a rough mental picture of the suspect. This mental picture provides a physical description, including distinguishing markings and visible mannerisms. Success makes the profile accurate, at least concerning a particular suspect as seen by witnesses. (For this Gather Information check, no money changes hands).
The Magical Girl Hunter can expand the profile by making an Investigate check (DC 15) involving the event’s scene or other evidence linked to the suspect. If successful, the Magical Girl Hunter combines eyewitness accounts with forensic evidence to develop a profile of the suspect’s method of operation. This provides a +2 circumstance bonus on any skill checks made to uncover additional evidence or otherwise locate and capture the suspect.

-M-FILES: Through either gossip with other hunters or personal experience and researches, you possess a large amount of information about many magical girls (be it a computer database, a journal, whatever). When you take a job, upon the first days of investigative job, you make an Investigate roll DC 18. Success means you can relate your current target’s modus operandi with that of another Magical Girl or Youma you have already crossed swords with (or you have heard about) in days past... been there, done that... but this time you can do it better: +2 on all combat rolls against her.

-WEAPON SPECIALIZATION: A Magical Girl Hunter gains Weapon Specialization with the selected Focus weapon. The Magical Girl Hunter gets a +2 bonus on damage rolls with the weapon.

-OCCULT KNOWLEDGE: The Magical Girl Hunter gains a +1 competence bonus per character level on Research and Knowledge (Arcane Lore) checks

-FOXHOUND: Through constant contact with magical girls, you have developed a sort of sixth sense to "sniff" them. Whenever you encounter a not-transformed magical girl, you are entitled to an instinctive Intelligence roll, DC 20 (secretly rolled by the GM). Success means you identify her as a magical girl. Also, you are able to see through their magical disguises: after any encounter with a magical girl, if you ever meet her in her non-magical persona (or an alternate transformation), you are entitled to automatic Spot and Intelligence rolls to recognize her, if looking for her in a crowd or street, the difficulty can go from 20-30 according to the situation and the crowd, and if met face-to-face, the difficulty is a mere 18. The GM is free to adjust the difficulties according to how drastic is the change.

Advanced Class: Slasher


The quintessential B-horror villain is the Slasher: a twisted monstrosity of a man with no conscience, living only to kill. A Slasher’s rampages may last for days, leaving a trail of bloody corpses, and all too often they end at the hands of mere teenagers.

Feat: Improved Critical (any slashing melee weapon).
Allegiance: Evil.
Special: Must have been (apparently) killed by the direct or indirect action of one or more teenagers.
OR
Special: Must have committed a particularly horrifying and/or gruesome murder.

Class Information
Hit Die: 1d12
Action Points: 4 + ½ character level, rounded down, every time the character attains a new level in this class.

Class Skills
The Slasher’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are: Climb (Str), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Navigate (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis).
Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

10th----- +7----- +5----- +5----- +3----- Sequel----- +5----- +2

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Slasher advanced class.

Weapon Focus
At 1st level, a Slasher gains the Weapon Focus class feature, providing the benefit of the feat with the same name. The Slasher adds +1 to all attack rolls made using the weapon that he has applied the Improved Critical feat to. If he has more than one Improved Critical feat, the Slasher must select one as a signature weapon.

Lethal Fists
At 1st level, a Slasher’s unarmed strikes do lethal damage. He can choose to inflict non-lethal damage without penalty.

Stalking
Beginning at 2nd level, a Slasher can relentlessly pursue one creature. The Slasher simply walks and will be right behind his victim, no matter how fast the victim can run. Each round, the Slasher can teleport to any location between 30 feet and 60 feet from the chosen victim. This supernatural ability lasts a number of rounds equal to the Slasher’s class level, and can be used up to three times each day.

Smash
Also at 2nd level, a Slasher inflicts double damage when striking objects such as doors, walls, weapons, etc. In addition, the Slasher gains a +4 bonus to all Strength checks involving the breaking of objects, like breaking down a door or snapping chains.

Bonus Feats
At 3rd and 6th level, the Slasher gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Slasher must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.
Archaic Weapons Proficiency, Armour Proficiency (light), Armour Proficiency (medium), Armour Proficiency (heavy), Brawl, Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Exotic Melee Weapon Proficiency, Far Shot, Great Cleave, Improved Brawl, Improved Knockout Punch, Knockout Punch, Power Attack, Stealthy, Track.

Death Flesh
At 4th level, the Slasher’s skin toughens. He gains a +2 natural armour bonus. If the Slasher already has natural armour, this bonus stacks.

Augmented Critical
At 5th level, the Slasher’s focused weapon’s threat range and critical multiplier increase by one, for example, from 17-20/x2 to 16-20/x3.

Improved Reaction
At 7th level, a Slasher gains a +2 competence bonus on initiative checks.

Weapon Specialization
At 8th level, a Slasher gains weapon specialization with the weapon that he has applied the Weapon Focus class feature to. The Slasher gets a +2 bonus on damage rolls with the chosen weapon.

Critical Strike
At 9th level, a Slasher gains the ability to automatically confirm a threat as a critical hit when attacking with the weapon he has applied weapon specialization to, eliminating the need to make a roll to confirm the critical hit.

Sequel
At 10th level, a Slasher gains the ability to return from apparent destruction; 1d6 years after the Slasher is destroyed, a chain of events will occur that will either bring him back from death, or make clear that he was never dead.

###############
While you wait, here is a new Advanced Class (made by Cyber-Dave).

"I have an understanding that Double-Oh's don't have a long life expectancy, so if I'm a mistake, then rest assured I'm a short-lived one."-paraphrased from recorded conversation, MI-6 Intelligence Archives.

THE SECRET AGENT

Soldiers come in all shapes, sizes, and skill sets, but of those who go through their early military training, some are chosen for a call of duty other than waging visible war. Those who show a propensity for stealth and investigation, while at the same time manifesting a perceptive ability above the norm, and a psychological profile that is capable of killing in the name of ones allegiance, are chosen to become something more. They become secret agents, men and women without a name or face, who gather information, and commit assassination, all in the name of their beliefs.

Requirements
To qualify to become an Agent, a character must fulfill the following criteria.
Base Attack Bonus: +2
Feat: Personal Firearms Proficiency.
Skills: Hide 6 ranks, Investigate 6 ranks, Search 6 ranks.
Special: Must have killed at least two people in the name of one's allegience, on an approved (and succesfully executed) mission.

Class Information
The following information pertains to the Agent advanced class.

Hit Die: 1d8
Action Points: 6 + one-half character level, rounded down, every time the Agent attains a new level in this class.

Class Skills: The Agent’s class skills are as follows.
Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Computer Use (Int), Disable Device (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Drive (Dex), Escape Artist (Dex), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Investigate (Int), Jump (Str), Knowledge (behavioral sciences, business, civics, current events, streetwise, tactics) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Navigate (Int), Pilot (Dex), Research (Int), Read Language (None), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Speak Language (none), Spot (Wis), Tumble (Dex).
Skill Points at Each Level: 5 + Int modifier (4 + Int modifier for nonhumans).

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Agent advanced class.

10th--- +7--- +3--- +7--- +5--- Betrayal--- +7--- +2

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Agent advanced class.

Observation
At 1st level an Agent learns to memorize routines and details of a target for infiltration purposes. A Agent may observe a target area, allowing her to emulate the ‘walk and talk’ of residents. A Agent must observe the target area for 1 minute, making a DC 15 spot check. If she succeeds she gains a +4 competence bonus on bluff, disguise, hide and sleight of hand checks in the area. A target area can be a palace, a fort, a small village, a caravan, or any other similarly sized location.

Swift Strike
At 2nd level, the Agent becomes skilled at taking down unwary targets quickly. He deals +1d6 points of damage on successful melee and ranged weapon attacks made against a flat-footed opponent. This extra damage can be lethal or nonlethal, as determined by the choice of weapon. A weapon that deals lethal damage must be used to deal lethal damage, a weapon that deals nonlethal damage must be used to deal nonlethal damage.
The extra damage increases to +2d6 at 5th level and +3d6 at 8th level.
NOTE: If using existing d20 Modern nonlethal rules, this power becomes over-powered with brawl. Thus, a GM should not allow swift-strike to work with brawl unless a nonlethal system that is more in line with dungeons and dragons is being used. The best possible fix is to state that swift strike may only be used when a character counts as armed, in such a case combat martial art swift strikes will work, but brawl swift strikes will not.

Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Agent gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Agent must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.
Advanced Combat Martial Arts, Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Aircraft Operation, Alertness, Armor Proficiency (light), Athletic, Attentive, Combat Throw, Dead Aim, Double Tap, Elusive Target, Far Shot, Forced Stop, Improved Combat Martial Arts, Improved Combat Throw, Improved Initiative, Low Profile, Nerve Pinch, Precise Shot, Quick Draw, Shot on the Run, Skip Shot, Stealthy, Surface Vehicle Operation, Trustworthy, Unbalance Opponent, Urban Tracking, Vehicle Dodge.

Perceptive Sweep
At 4th level an Agent learns how to size up an area and get the lay of the land in a single sweep of his or her eyes. This sweep provides a +4 circumstance bonus on Spot checks and covers an area out to 30 feet away from the Agent. The Agent can use this bonus as a move action to discover obvious enemies, alarms, surveillance devices, traps, escape routes, the presence of concealed weapons, or important documents. Furthermore, the Agent is far more attuned to clues then the average investigator. An Agent’s Perceptive Sweep may also be used as a move action to make a Spot check to notice any visible clues in a 30-foot spread away from the Agent (note that clues are usually found with a Search check). When using the Perceptive Sweep to discover clues, an Agent does not gain a +4 circumstance bonus to his spot checks.
Anything not concealed can be spotted in a sweep with a DC equal to 10 + or – the objects size modifier. The DC for concealed or less obvious threats is equal to their Hide or Slight of Hand check result (as appropriate).

Improved Perceptive Sweep
At 7th level, an Agent’s ability to get the lay of the land improves. Now the Agent not only spots potential perils or clues with a successful check, he or she can immediately determine the relative danger or importance of each danger and clue discovered with a successful Spot check. As a free action, an Agent may make a sense motive check to discover each and every danger’s nature and strength compared to the Agent. An Agent makes the Sense Motive check against each target’s Bluff check. A successful check lets the Agent know the class composition (ie: Strong, Tough, Smart, Soldier etc…) of the target. A check that succeeds by 5 or more relates the target’s strength compared to the Agent: stronger (higher level or Hit Dice), on par (same level or HD), or weaker (lower level or HD). A check that succeeds by 10 or more relates the exact levels of a target’s class composition to the Agent (ie: 2 levels Strong, 1 level Tough, 3 levels Smart, 2 levels Soldier, etc…). Furthermore, an Agent who uses his Perceptive Sweep to discover clues may immediately make an Investigate check, as a free action, to discover the importance/glean information from each and every clue discovered with an Agent’s Perceptive Sweep. An Agent cannot learn information about a clue that requires a lab (such as the blood type of blood spatters).

Betrayal
At 10th level an Agent becomes adept at putting a target at ease, then striking like lightning. An Agent must spend an action point to use this ability; the Agent makes a Bluff check opposed by the target Sense Motive check. If the target has any bodyguards, the Agent’s Bluff check must defeat the opposed bluff checks of the guards as well. If the Agent succeeds she has successfully put her target, and his guards, at ease. The target is considered unaware of the Agents presence as a threat, and helpless (the target is thus susceptible to a coup de grace) for one round, even if the target has taken precautions (such as stationing bodyguards, placing his or her back to a wall, or making Spot checks). If the target is in combat, or some other tense and obviously dangerous situation (and therefore in a state of acute awareness and readiness), the Agent may not use this ability.

Credit where credit is due: this class was created by Luke Swadling (who made the coolest (and only) D20M adaptation of Drizzit I've seen).

STREET SAMURAI ADVANCED CLASS


Street Samurai are more than mere grunts with a gun. Their expertise is not in causing damage, but in surviving to cause it. They are preternaturally alert, never surprised, and always cool. Whereas a soldier’s specialty is honed to a fine point in combat, a street samurai’s fine-point specialty is combat- they understand its flow, its rhythm, and its timing.

It isn't uncommon for a Super team to have a Brick in its upper echelons (Superman of the Justice League, for instance.

New Advanced Class: Avatar
There are some superheroes and supervillains that gain their powers not from mutations, gadgets, or magic, but from a spirit that exists within them. These are the Avatars, supers that are either respected or envied by their peers. The most famous of the Avatar Fictions is the Champion, a collected superhero force that can rival Superman in power ((doesn't hurt that it is usually part Brick)). Former Champions have included Miss Champion, the now headmistress of Whateley Academy Ms. Carson. The fastest path into this advanced class is through the Dedicated Hero class, though other paths are possible.


Requirements
To become an Avatar, a character must fulfill the following criteria.
BAB: +3.
Abilities: Wisdom 14+.
Skills: Knowledge (Arcane lore) 6 ranks, Sense Motive 6 ranks.
Feats: Attentive.

Class Information
The following information pertains to the Avatar advanced class.

Hite Die
The Avatar gains 1d8 hit points per level. The character's Constitution modifier applies.

Action Points
The Avatar gains a number of action points equal to 6 + one-half her character level, rounded down, every time she attains a new level in this class.

Class Skills
The Brick's class skills are as follows.
Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Computer Use (Int), Concentration (Con), Disguise (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Investigate (Int), Jump (Str), Knowledge (Arcane lore, earth and life sciences, history) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str).

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Avatar advanced class.

Inner Spirit
At 1st level, the Avatar has a spirit that comes to preside within herself for some reason. This trigger is deposited by the GM, and he may choose if the spirit is without question entered or may be rebuked. If the latter, the character may choose to make a Will save (DC 10 + the spirit's living class level; usually 20 for cases like the Faerie Queen and Champion Force) to rebuke the spirit and prevent its entry. The spirit is a (for the most part) harmless symbiotic being, providing power and protection in exchange for a mortal "house" to stay in. At the start, an Avatar may only have a single spirit. Even if the original Prime Spirit has since (if able) left the body or "died", the post-Avatar retains her previous genetic rewrite Body Template and other abilities of this class. An Avatar may choose to be "homeless" concerning spirits until she finds one she likes.

Body Template
When the 1st spirit (hereafter known as the Prime Spirit) enters the Avatar as a host, it will reform the body to its prime choosing. This change may be instantaneous or take months, it may be just some strengths and a costume, or a full species, age, even gender rewrite. The below table gives some examples of Prime Spirits (some such as Bast are already taken by Fictions but are given for completeness and basis for similar Prime Spirits).


Spirit Commune
At 2nd level, an Avatar gains the ability to commune with her inner spirit and let it "pilot" the nerves to allow special powers to flow forth. At 2nd level, this can only be done once a day, but the amount per day doubles every three levels. To perform a spirit commune, an Avatar must sit and focus for 2d6 rounds. The specific effect of a commune depends on the Prime Spirit (see examples above.)

Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Avatar gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Avatar must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.
Advanced Combat Martial Arts, Agile Riposte, Archaic Weapons Proficiency, Armor Proficiency (Light), Blind-Fight, Combat Martial Arts, Combat Throw, Defensive Martial Arts, Dodge, Elusive Target, Endurance, Great Fortitude, Heroic Surge, Improved Combat Martial Arts, Improved Damage Threshold, Improved Grapple, Mobility, Precise Strike, Renown, Toughness, Trustworthy.

Spirit Defense
At 4th level, the Avatar can use her spirit as a mental shield. She gains a +4 bonus to saves against mind-affecting abilities, spells, equipment, and psionics.

Spirit Sucker
At 5th level, the Avatar can touch an unprotected spirit (one that is not in a body or some form of complete covering such as possessing an inanimate object without seams) and literally suck it into her body, allowing for a Secondary Spirit to exist alongside the prime. The Avatar may call upon that spirit in the commune and gains a further +4 bonus to saves against the various forms of mind-affecting, but does not gain the body template of the secondary spirit.

Spirit Possession
At 7th level, the Avatar's spirit can be allowed to "full drive" its host's body, giving her powerful access. When the Prime Spirit goes into a mode of control, and may give knowledge, cast any spells, and cast any psionics it knew in life. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 2d8 + the Avatar's class level, and may be stopped prematurely with a Will save (the same save amount as rebuking a spirit).

Spirit Habitat
At 8th level, the Avatar can sustain another spirit in her mind, maximizing the amount of spirits to 3. The Third Spirit gives the same bonuses as a Secondary Spirit.

Paragon Strength
At 10th level, the Avatar can call on her Prime Spirit to energize her in battle with near unstoppable power. Once per day, she may call upon the spirit to aid her in full-on combat strength. She is treated as 2 levels higher for the purposes of casting spells or psionics and gains DR 10/+3. The effect lasts the same number of rounds as her Spirit Possession special ability, and after it subsides, she is fatigued for the rest of the encounter.

New Prestige Class: Deviser
Devisers are, in essence, the ultimate techies. While a techie makes fabulous gadgets, a Deviser makes fabulous gadgets that defy all known lays of physics. They can create such defiant creations by working under a usage of technology principle not fully understood that is commonly called "The Schimmlehorn Effect". Devisers in school systems such as Whateley are often moreso taught ethics than invention: they tend to have a bit of the "Mad Scientist gene" and their creations can sometimes be a bit too hard to handle. Devisers fresh out of the Academy are often picked up by various militaries and governments due to how much oddities of nature they can manage. Their unique creations, known as Devises, are prized for both their power and their uniqueness: it is basically impossible to reverse-engineer a Devise unless you are another Deviser. The fastest path into this prestige class is through the Smart Hero class and the Techie advanced class, but that isn't the only path.

Requirements
To become a Deviser, a character must fulfill the following criteria.
Abilities: Intelligence 16+.
Skills: Craft (Electronic, mechanical) 8 ranks.
Feats: Gearhead, Meticulous.

Class Information

Action Points
The Deviser gains a number of action points equal to 6 + one-half her character level, rounded down, every time she attains a new level in this class.

Class Skills
The Deviser's class skills are as follows.
Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Profession (Wis), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str).

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Deviser prestige class.

Lesser Devise
At 1st level, a Deviser can craft oddities known as Devises: objects that by means even the Deviser does not understand have more powers than what they would imply, and oddly just the ones she wants. When using Craft (Electronic or mechanical), she may increase the Craft DC by 5 to automatically install a gadget up to DC +2 without needing to produce the extra cost for materials. The Deviser chooses her gadget within the limits of the campaign's rules.

Jury-rig +X
At 2nd level, the Deviser gains a +2 bonus to Repair checks made to attempt temporary or jury-rigged repairs. If she already has jury-rig +2, the bonus is +4. Is she already has jury-rig +4, the bonus is increased to +6.

Bonus Feat
At 3rd level, the Deviser gains a bonus feat. The feat must be chosen from the following list, and the Deviser must meet all the prerequisites.
Armor Proficiency (Light, medium, powered), Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Alien Technology Proficiency.

Greater Devise
At 4th level, the Deviser's gadget DC limit for her Devise creation is increased to +4, and a Devise can be created with up to 2 gadgets.

The Schimmlehorn Effect
At 5th level, the Deviser can create gadgets that do whatever she wants on a whim. Her gadget DC limit increases to DC +6, and a Devise can be created with up to 3 gadgets.

I'll try to figure out the Coordinator stat ideas and will have the first Gazette article up sometime today. First, I have the start of an Avatar concept.

A new class (adapted from 'The Future Soldier's Battlefield Handbook', by Steampower Publishing).


Miriailla Haww, CNN (LaGrange) War Correspondent. Photo taken November 5, 2003, in downtown Denver.

(AN: I've managed to see bits and pieces of 'GS Destiny' and have pretty much decided to steer clear of it as a whole. Not to say that I don't like it, but it's just a basic concept. Aside from the fact that 'Destiny' might never air here (and if it does, it might actually be approved and voiced by the actual 'Seed' cast)).

WAR CORRESPONDENT ADVANCED CLASS.


War might be Hell, but it also gives ratings. Be it during the 1930s or far into the Cosmic Era, on the French countryside or deep in space, War Correspondents face all kinds of dangers in order to obtain the one story that -they believe- will give them recognition and glory. That they -secretly- enjoy the thrill that comes from 'dodging bullets' doesn't helps them, either.

On Coreline, some of the best field reporters (and especially those that survived the Hours) are (or were) War Correspondents. They are trusted and respected by their fellow reporters because of their stories, and hated by more than one faction because of their published plans.

The fastest route to obtain the War Correspondent Advanced class is theu the Dedicated Hero Basic Class.

REQUIREMENTS:
To become a War Correspondent, a character must fulfill the following criteria.

Skills: Concentration 8 Ranks, Gather Information 8 Ranks.

HIT DIE: The War Correspondent obtains 1d6 + Con Hit Points per level.

CLASS SKILLS: The War Correspondent's skills are the following:

Bluff, Climb, Computer Use, Concentration, Diplomacy, Disguise, Drive, Gather Information, Hide, Intimidate, Jump, Knowledge (History, Military), Listen, Move Silently, Sense Motive, Spot, Survival and Swim.

Skill Points per Level: 5 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES:

Courage Under Fire: The War Correspondent keeps a straight face and a cool head, even when the most epic (and frantic) of firefights erupt around her.
When in the middle of a battle, the War Correspondent adds her class level as a morale bonus to any Concentration checks or Will saves made to resist morale effects.

Out of Harm's Way: There is no better television that the War Correspondent reporting while a battle rages in the background. The War Correspondent is well-versed at putting herself in harm's way and yet surviving unscathed. Even when in the open, the War Correspondent counts as if she was in cover. The Correspondent gains no additional bonuses while in cover.

Low-Profile Target: The War Correspondent might make high-profile news, but even when in the line of fire, they know how to maintain a low profile. So long as the attacker has other potential targets available, he must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + Correspondent class levels) to target the Correspondent. If the attacker has no such targets, he may target the Correspondent freely.

Potential targets are targets that are easy to hit and that the attacker can damage with his weapon-foe example, a sniper faced with the choice whether to shoot the Correspondent and a tank would freely target the Correspondent, as his rifle could not damage the tank. If the Correspondent was standing next to an infantryman, then the sniper would be forced to pass a Will save to target the Correspondent instead of the infantryman.

Battle Intuition: The War Correspondent has a nose for danger and trouble, and is an expert at positioning herself right in the middle of the action. When the Correspondent is in the midst of a battle or reporting on a war, the GM might call on a Gather Information check with a variable DC depending on the situation. Success indicates that the War Correspondent has a hunch that a story is about to occur or that she is in imminent danger. If the check is passed by 5 or more, the Correspondent recieves a rough sense of what is going to happen-she gains a hunch that the building she is standing on is about to be bombed, or that the troop transport she is reporting from is a target from enemy raiders.

Avoid Trouble: Although the War Correspondent has a knack for getting into trouble spots, she is also adept at getting out again-mostly in one piece. This ability functions alongside Battle Intuition. Any time that the Correspondent's Intuition warns her of immediate danger that can be realistically avoided-a nearby bomb blast or sniper fire, perhaps-, the GM may make a Reflex save (DC 20) for them in secret. If succesful, the danger is avoided or lessened in some way-they duck out of the sniper's scope at the last second or are shielded from the worst of the explosion.

I have returned...with a bunch of stuff that has arisen from being without my DSL and stat blocker. Also, Marco, a 5-level advanced class in d20 Modern is considered a prestige class, but the name doesn't really matter to me. Nice pic of Miriallia Haw to go with it.

Connected with the spineless lurkers of the world, an expert Invertimaster can tame even the biggest bugs. He has a special knack for connecting with the mindless insects, cunning cephalopods, and deadly arachnids. Some are inspired by Invertimasters while others revile them and their no-backboned friends. Their motives can be just as varied as the responses of others. Some Invertimasters just love bugs, others seek to shape the world in an invertebratoid image, and some have no other companions to turn to.

Spineless Species
As a full-round action, an Invertimaster can change his species. He replaces his own species traits with the new species' and must take another full-round action to change into another species with the exception of his own, which is a free action. The species can be a Vrusk, Urban Drider, Kamarian, Mustafarian, or any Small, Medium, or Large invertebrate humanoid or monstrous humanoid of an LA of +2 or less from another homebrew or 3rd party source with a GM's consent.

Bonus Feat
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Invertimaster gains a bonus feat. These feats must be chosen from the following list and all prerequisites must be met.
Acrobatic, Alertness, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Martial Artist, Dodge, Frightful Presence, Lightning Reflexes, Planetary Adaptation, Power Attack, Stealthy, Track.

Poison Resist
From 4th level onward, the Invertimaster adds his level in this advanced class to saves against poison.

Summon the Swarm
Once per day, the Invertimaster can summon a monstrous spider, shadowmoth, sentient killer bee, or West Nile mosquito swarm from Urban Arcana or a centipede, locust, or spider swarm from the D&D SRD.

Viral Resist
From 7th level onward, the Invertimaster adds his level in this advanced class to saves against diseases.

Silken Armor
At 8th level, any armor worn by the Invertimaster that he is proficient in gets a +2 bonus to its maximum Dexterity bonus.

Spineless Giant
At 10th level, the Invertimaster is in touch with the full power of mighty invertebrates, but at a risk. As a full-round action, he may transform into a giant squid, giant octopus, Huge monstrous spider, Huge monstrous scorpion, Huge monstrous centipede, brine swimmer (Sandstorm), and giant ant lion (Sandstorm) and he gains all of the stats of that creature. Changing form into another creature or his own form takes the time amount as for the Spineless Species, but due to his new basal invertebrate mind, he must make a Will save (DC 20) to change. Failing 3 times in a single day will mean that the Invertimaster is trapped in that form for a week. After that time is over, he may try again or perform a Will save (DC 18) to permanently become an awakened member of that species.

THE GUERILLA FIGHTER


Conflict changes people. It may turn them from not considering to hurt anyone into the very example of blood-thirstyness. They learn how to fight unconventionally, ghosts that rise to destroy any hostiles.

The advent of the Hours brought many types of guerilla factions to the fore. From the Fictions guerilla factions that battled against hyper-advanced enemies from beyond the stars (or the government) to the groups of Pre-Vanishing Humans that banded together and took a stand (however pitiful it was).

To Become a Guerilla Fighter, the character must have the following:

BAB: +5.
Feats: Oathbound, Track.
Skills: Move Silently 4 Ranks, Survival 8 Ranks.

CLASS FEATURES:

+Guerilla Warfare: At 1st Level, the Guerilla Fighter dedicates himself to the cause-fixing in his mind who he is fighting and why he is fighting for. The Guerilla Fighter should specify his home soil-where it is he is defending, be it a whole planet, a country or one city. He must also specify the enemy that he is pledged to drive from his home soil. The specifics of these are left to the GM's discretion, but they should be reasonably specific and not at all generic ("To free Springfield, Mass. from ZAFT influence" would be acceptable, wheras "to free the planet from evil" would not).

+Local Knowledge: Fighting to defend their home soil, Guerilla Fighters are intimately familiar with eevry aspect of their homeland. When on home soil, the Guerilla Fighter gains a bonus to all relevant Knowledge and Survival checks equal to their class level.

+Hated Enemy: Guerilla Fighters are sworn to cleanse their homeland from the taint of their foes, and excel at fighting them. The Guerilla Fighter gains a +1 morale bonus to attack and damage rolls, Bluff, Disguise, Hide, Intimidate and Sense Motive checks made when fighting their chosen enemy. Their bonus increases to +2 at 5th level and and to +3 at 8th level.

+Network of Contacts: As the Guerilla Fighter advances in his 'career', he develops a network of contacts both within his organization and among the general populace. In order to tap into the Network of Contacts, there must be members of their culture present and the Guerilla Fighter must first make a Reputation check. The check may be further modified at the GM's discretion, applying up to a +5 bonus or penalty if there is a specially large or small number of potential friends.

If succesful, the Guerilla Fighter may request one of the following from his contacts:

+Pass a message to another member of the Resistance.
+Obtain a single piece of information or a secret.
+Obtain a piece of equipment or weaponry.
+Gain limited or temporary use of a vehicle.
+Gain access to a shelter or hiding place.

The request takes a variable amount of time depending on the request, but typically takes 24 hours. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 15 the time taken is halved, to a minimum of 1 minute. The time taken remains at the discretion of the GM-some requests simply cannot be completed quickly.

If the check is failed, then either the Guerilla Fighters fails to find his contacts, or they are not in position to help at the time. If the check is failed by 10 or more, some mishap has befallen the Network or the Guerilla Fighter-the supposed contact might turn out to be a double-agent or an assassin sent to kill the Guerilla Fighter, the Network might have been exposed by enemy soldiers and contacts got killed, or the contacts might have carried out the request incorrectly, delivering the message to the wrong person or passing on false information to the Guerilla Fighter.

The Guerilla Fighter may attempt to use their Network of Contacts freely once every 24 hours. If the Guerilla Fighter attempts to use the Network more often, the DC of the check is increased by 5 every time, increasing the risk of a major mishap occuring and slowing the time for requests to be completed.

+Alien Weapon Familiarity: Often forced to steal the weapons from the grasp of their fallen enemies, guerillas are intimately familiar with the workings of enemy weapons and equipment. The Guerilla Fighter gains the Alien Weapons Proficiency Feat.

(Guerilla Fighters that come from universes with no aliens can replace the Feat with a weapons-related Feat of their choice, as long as they meet the Prerequisites and gain GM approval).

+Melt Away: The operatives of the Resistance excel at strking from the midst of a group of civilians before melting away again into a crowd. When in a crowd of at least ten, the GUerilla Fighter gains a +5 circumstance bonus to Hide and Disguise checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five additional people in the crowd. This bonus is halved if less than half of the crowd is made up of friendly forces.

+Feared by the Enemy: The mere mention of the Guerilla Fighter and his exploits is enough to send a wave of fear through the occupying forces. The Resistance knows how to use this fear to their advantage, spreading rumours-some true, some less so-of their deeds to demoralize their enemy.
To properly do this takes time to prepare: 1 hour per intended target. The Guerilla Fighter may select a number of enemy targets equal to his class level, and he must at least know his intended targets by sight-the Guerilla Fighter should select the targets from a regular patrol, sentry position or barracks as a target.

After the preparations have been made, the targets must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + character level) or incur a penalty to all attack, damage and skill checks equal to the Guerilla Fighter's advanced class level for the next 24 hours.

+Improvised Device: Guerilla Fighters are often forced to scavenge for mechanical parts to maintain their weapons and devices, and as a result are skilled at converting one piece of equipment into another.

The Guerilla Fighter decides which item he wishes to manufacture, and the GM determines the amount of time necessary to make it. The Guerilla Fighter then makes a Repair check at a DC dependant on the complexity of the task and the materials available (usually DC 25+). If successful, the device works as normal, for a short time at least. The Guerilla Fighter can make any simple devices, such as a radio, as well as somewhat more complex equipent such as handheld weaponry and explosives.

+Beloved of the People: At 10th Level, the Guerilla Fighter has become a great hero of the Resistance, beloved by his people everywhere. His Network of Contacts becomes more proactive and helpful, even to the point of taking up arms and assisting the Guerilla Fighter in battle. Each time the Guerilla Fighter requests help -and sometimes if he does not, should one of his contacts notice that he is in trouble- he can gain the assistance of 2d12 armed men and women from the local population, assuming there are sufficient allies that can help.
This ability functions as a request from the Network of Contacts, and the time taken for the Network to muster is determined by the success of the check-if in dire straits at least 1d6 allies can be mustered immediately. The GM should determine the levels and classes of the allies.

UNSC BOARDING ASSAULT MARINE


The United Nations Space Command is a faction with many things against it. From the point of view of the opposing force, they have retrograde technology, little numbers, few allies and damn near zero hope.

So the UNSC has had to compensate. The UNSC Marines are trained in Camp Weaver, PLANT 17, for zero-gravity, boarding and close-quarters combat. The Boarding Assault Marine is a fully voluntary force within the UNSC, who is trained further than the standard. They are the sledgehammer that brings the door down and the shield that keeps the bad guys at bay while everybody else is gunning for the ship's bridge.

The Assault Marines develop a fatalistic attitude (after all, it's their fault, nobody else's, that they are the frontliners) and a vow to try and leave the stage with a bang-which might not come to happen if their ship gets shot out of the sky.

But they do not show this attitude as much, since they know one ting for sure: in a Sol System and surroundings full of pirates, rampaging xenobeings and wanna-be conquerors, they surely are the meanest of the bunch.

REQUIREMENTS:

To become an Assault Marine, the character must have the following:

BAB: +10.
Feats: Endurance, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Weapon Focus.
Skills: Hide 10 Ranks, Move Silently 10 Ranks, Survival 10 Ranks.
Special: Must be a member of the UNSC.

CLASS INFORMATION:

Hit Die: 1d10 + Con Modifier.

Class Skills:
Climb, Concentration, Drive, Hide, Intimidate, Jump, Listen, Move Silently, Pilot, Spot, Survival, Swim, Treat Injury.

CLASS FEATURES:

+Advanced Weapons Training: Assault Marines are trained in a wide variety of weapons. At 1st Level and every five levels thereafter, the Marine selects a weapons for which he already has Weapon Focus. When using that weapon, the Assault Marine now gains a +1 circumstance bonus to attack and damage rolls. This bonus stacks with both Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization. Alternatively, the Assault Marine may instead take the Weapon Focus Feat.

+Explosives Expert: The Assault Marines are trained in the use of explosives, such as hand grenades and flash-bangs, to flush out enemies and soften up an area, and they are adept at placing a grenade exactly where is needed to have the maximum effect. The DC for all saving throws to avoid the effects of a grenade or explosive device used by an Assault Marine is increased by an ammount equal to his class level.

+Boarding Specialist: At 2nd Level, the Assault Marine becomes an expert at boarding an enemy vessel, moving swiftly and silently throught the corridors to seize his objective. When on an enemy vessel, the Assault Marine gains a +1 morale bonus to Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot and Search checks. This bonus increases at 4th Level and every other level thereafter.

+Sudden Strike: Assault Marines are trained to strike swiftly and without compromise. When attacking from cover or concealment, an Assault Marine gains a +2 morale bonus to attack and damage rolls.

+Overwhelming Force: At 7th Level, the Assault Marine attacks with so much force and determination that an enemy gains few advantages from being holed up in cover. A target attacked by an Assault Marine has any cover bonuses less than total cover reduced by one step-nine tenths cover is reduced to three-quarters cover, three-quarters cover to half cover and so on.

+Shock Tactics: At 9th Level, the Assault Marine strikes deep into the heart of his opponents, making it seem as though they are under assault from dozens of troops instead of a singe soldier. Enemies within 30 ft of an Assault Marine incur a -2 morality penalty to attack, damage, defense and saving throws. This penalty is not cumulative if more than one Assault Marine of 9th Level or higher is within 30 ft, but the radius increases by an additional 30 ft for each Marine present, making an entire unit of Assault Marines a particularly terrifying opponent.

The poster boys (and girls) of every race's fleet and the heroes in every intergalactic war, the Fighter Aces' tales usually inspire another generation to enlist in the fleet. The Fighter Ace is a dogfighting veteran with few equals and a wingful of kill counts. They excel at fighter combat, and few who dare take them on in battle live to tell the tale.

Famous Coreline Fighter Aces include: Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace (easily the most recognizable Ace of the Colonial Fleet), Lufy 'Riff Raff' Metcalf (former Solnoid Attacker, now famous 'transporter' in Chicago), Mu La Flaga (although most people discuss that it might be because he's a Newtype) and Christopher Blair (those Alts of him that are STILL pilots, in any case).

REQUIREMENTS:

To become an Assault Marine, the character must have the following:

Feats: Starship Battle Run, Starship Dodge, Starship Operation (Ultralight).
Skills: Computer Use 8 Ranks, Pilot 13 Ranks.

CLASS INFORMATION:

Hit Die: 1d8 + Con Modifier.

Class Skills:
Computer Use, Concentration, Drive, Intimidate, Jump, Knowledge (Tactics), Listen, Pilot, Spot and Survival.

Skill Points: 5 + Int Modifier.

CLASS FEATURES:

+Favored Ship: The Fighter Ace would be less than useless without his trusty flying machine. Many Fighter Aces spend most of their careers carefully maintaining, repairing and upgrading the same machine over and over again, rather than taking a newer model. At 1st Level, the Fighter Ace selects a specific fighter -space or atmospheric- to be their favord ship. So long as the Fighter Ace is piloting their favored ship, he gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Pilot checks, Technical checks, and attack and damage rolls for every two Fighter Ace levels he possesses.

Many of the Fighter Ace's special abilities are dependant of them being in their favored ship. When not in their favord ship, but in a fighter of the same class, the numerical bonus of all such abilities is halved. No bonus is gained when flying any other class of ship.

To designate a new starship as his favorite ship, the Fighter Ace must pilot it for at least a month.

+Maximum Thrust: At 2nd Level, the Fighter Ace has learnt to coax a little more out of his ship. and to cope with the inherent increase in gees. When in his favored ship, the Fighter Ace may make a maximum thrust as a move action. To do this he must make a Pilot check (DC 20) and if successful he moves as through surging forwards, moving at 4 times tactical speed.

+Trademark Maneuver: As the Fighter Ace progresses in his career, he develops a unique flying style with characteristic maneuvers that identify him in battle. At 3rd, 6th and 9th Levels, the Fighter Ace may select any of the below actions to be a trademark maneuver. Once per round, the Fighter Ace may attempt a trademark maneuver. He must make a Pilot check (DC 20), and if he succeeds a full-round action becomes a move action, and a move or attack action becomes a free action.

A Fighter Ace may use this ability even when not in his favored ship.

The folllowing actins may be selected as a trademark maneuver:

-Attack actions (become free actions): aid another, escape a grappling ship, feint or total defense.
-Move actions (become free actions): jink, operate sensors, out of nowhere, ram, and send/jam a transmission.
-Full round actions (become move actions): jump to cruising speed, withdraw.

+Out of Nowhere: At 4th Level, the Fighter Ace is able to strike seemingly from out of nowhere, positioning his craft to avoid the sensors of an enemy vessel or to blindside an enemy pilot. When in his favored ship, the Fighter Ace may attempt to come out of nowhere as a move action. The Fighter Ace makes a Pilot check (DC 15) and, if successful, any Sensor checks made to detect his craft are reduced by an amount equal to his character level.

+Jink: To the untrained eye, the Fighter ace flies erratically, zig-zagging, looping and rolling all the while. Of course, this is all part of their skill, keeping an opponent from locking onto their craft and getting a clear shot. When in his favored ship, the Fighter Ace may make a Pilot roll (DC 20) and, if succesful, may add his class level to the Defense of his craft for one round.

+Wing Commander: Although at their most confident when operating alone, the Fighter Ace appreciates the usefulness of wingmen to provide cover and run interference. At this stage in their career, the Fighter ace has been given a wing of ultralight fighters to command. A wing led by a Fighter Ace gains the advantage of the Fighter Ace's special abilities and bonuses. The maximum wing size is equal to half the Fighter Ace's class levels. A larger wing may not use the Fighter Ace's abilities except as noted in the main rules.

+Quick Recovery: Fighter Aces poseess almost superhuman skills, but even they make mistakes-albeit rarely. The difference is that a Fighter Ace is able to recover from his mistakes much quicker, limiting their effects. Should a fighter Ace become dazed, entangled, grappled, immobilized, shaken, stunned or suffer a mishap while piloting any ship, he may make a Pilot check (DC 25). A successful roll means that the Fighter Ace can recover from the adverse effects far more quickly and than a regular pilot, halving the duration rounding fractions down.

+Damage Roll: The Fighter Ace may attempt to execute a damge roll to avoid the worst of a direct hit, causing a missile to explode nearby or a laser beam to glance off the hull. When in his favored ship, the Fighter Ace may make a damage roll as a move action. The Fighter Ace makes a Pilot check (DC 25) and, if successful, may add his class level to the Defense of his ship for the next attack that strikes it.

+Blaze of Glory: When all is lost, many a Fighter Ace has chosen to go down fighting, ending it all in a blaze of glory and taking a good many foes with him. When in his favored ship, the Fighter Ace may decide to execute a Blaze of Glory as a move action. The Blaze of Glory is effectively a ramming maneuver against another vessel. The Fighter Ace makes a Pilot check as normal to execute the ram, but may add his class level to the check and, if succesful, damage dealt is doubled. A Fighter Ace who successfully performs a Blaze of Glory is slain instantly, but will long be remembered as a great hero.

+Group Captain: At 10th Level, the Fighter Ace is promoted once again, gaining multiple wings of fighters to control, all of whom gain the benefit of the Fighter Ace's abilities. The maximum size of the Fighter Ace's group increases to ten

FIGHTER ACES AND DOGFIGHTERS:


The Fighter Ace is similar in concept to the Dogfighter Advanced Class, and it is entirely possible for a character to have levels in both. The special abilities and bonuses of both classes stack with, and complement, one another.

Just as a Dogfighter is an elite pilot, a Fighter Ace is an elite Dogfighter, making the most seasoned of pilots look fresh out of the academy. There are perhaps no more than a handful of Fighter Aces in any one military, each a familiar face and celebrity within their culture.

THE MARTIAL DUELIST



Two sides of a particular coin: the Smiling Soldier and the cold Cleric.

For thousands of years, humans have created martial forms of movement, or katas, designed to maximize their combative potential. These martial arts have traditionally enhanced their practitioner’s hand-to-hand or thrown weapon combat ability.

A thing that Fiction writers devised, with the evolution of technology, was an evolution of techniques. Although many people (so-called 'scholars') took a look at this invented art and scoffed at it, now they are mostly dead or humbled... mostly at the hands of such an art.

Many factions of Coreline use in some way 'Gun Katas', from the powerful Grammaton Clerigy to the most humble of traveling gunslingers. Not every gunslinger can call himself a Martial Duelist, and every Martial Duelist considers himself a martial artist first. As well, not all Martial Duelists shoot to kill, but the most well-known of them at least maim thru trick-shots.

Where the Martial Artist continues to focus on hands and melee or thrown weaponry, the Martial Duelist fuses traditional defensive martial arts with combative motions designed to increase his lethality with a firearm.

The fastest path into this Advanced Class is through a mix of the Fast and Dedicated hero base classes.

Martial Duelist 

Requirements
To qualify to become a Martial Duelist, a character must fulfill the following criteria.
Base Attack Bonus: +2.
Skills: Knowledge (Philosophy and Theology) 6 ranks, Tumble 6 ranks.
Feats: Combat Martial Arts, Defensive Martial Arts, Personal Firearms Proficiency.
Class Information
Hit Die: 1d8
Action Points: 6 + one-half character level, rounded down, every time the martial artist attains a new level in this class.
Class Skills
The Martial Duelist’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are: Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (current events, popular culture, theology and philosophy) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Perform (dance) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Read/Write Language (none), Speak Language (none), Spot (Wis), Tumble (Dex).
Skill Points at Each Level: 3 + Int modifier.

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Martial Duelist advanced class.

Hands of a Master
Your mastery of the gun as a weapon transcends the limits of its design. In conjunction with your martial arts training, your guns become a part of your hand. If either pistol whipping or using a rifle butt in melee, you gain the benefits of any unarmed combat feats and you add unarmed strike damage to the weapon damage. For example, if you possess the Combat Martial Arts, Improved Combat Martial Arts, and Advanced martial arts feats then a pistol whip would do base damage of 2d4 with a critical threat range of 19-20/x3 damage. If you possess only the Combat Martial Arts and Improved Combat Martial Arts feats than a rifle butt would do 1d4+1d6 and threaten a critical on a 19-20/x2 damage. When making pistol whips or rifle butts, as when making unarmed attacks, you may choose whether to deal lethal or nonlethal damage with no penalty to your attacks.

Moving Target
Starting at 2nd level, a Martial Duelist learns to master his combative motions, becoming a particularly difficult target to hit when moving. So long as the Martial Duelist moves more than a 5foot step in a round, and is unarmoured and unencumbered, all opponents suffer a –4 to hit him with ranged attacks.

Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Martial Duelist gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Martial Duelist must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.
Advanced Combat Martial Arts, Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Advanced Two-Weapon Fighting, Burst Fire, Dead to Rights, Double Tap, Elusive Target, Improved Combat Martial Arts, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Quick Draw, Quick Reload, Shot on the Run, Strafe, Two-Weapon Fighting.

Guns Akimbo
At 4th level you become skilled at delivering massive firearms attacks while on the move. If you have two ranged weapons, as an attack action you may make one attack with each weapon. In addition to the penalties you normally suffer for attacking with two weapons, you suffer an additional –2 penalty on each attack.

Close Combat Shot
At 5th level, a Martial Duelist gains the ability to make a ranged attack with a Medium-size or smaller firearm while in a threatened area without provoking an attack of opportunity.

Lightning Shot
Starting at 7th level, a Martial Duelist can make a flurry of ranged attacks with a personal firearm at the expense of accuracy. With a lightning shot, the Martial Duelist may make one extra ranged attack with a personal firearm in a round at her highest base attack bonus. This attack and each other attack made in the round take a –2 penalty. This ability can only be used when taking the full attack action. The penalty applies to all attacks for one full round, including attacks of opportunity.

Master of the Gun Katas
At 8th level a Martial Duelist has mastered the pattern of movements used to both avoid getting hit while simultaneously shooting in a manner most likely to hit his target. He can push the gun katas to their limits, performing feats that even other Martial Duelists marvel at. When wielding a firearm, unarmored and unencumbered, a Martial Duelist may expend an action point to add his Wisdom bonus (if any) to both his attack bonus and his class defence for one round.

Gun-Fu
At 10th level a Martial Duelist becomes a master of combining motion with attack. He meshes martial arts with gunplay and performs amazing stunts of duelling with firearms. In any round in which a Martial Duelist makes a full-attack using only handguns, as a swift action he may make a single Tumble check (DC 20) to gain ½ his movement rate in movement as a free action. In any round in which a Martial Duellist uses Gun-Fu, he may not also make a five foot step.
#######
I just got finished with my Cowpoke prestige class. I must say that the concept is much different than the Martial Duelist, which is what I want. The Martial Duelist seems more like a modern gunman while mine is attempting to get the feel of the Wild West. Yes, most of the class features are bonus givers, but that is what I wanted.
New Prestige Class: Cowpoke
Some heroes and gunslingers can call them selves cowboys and cowgirls, but you can run circles around them. You can shoot a penny in midair, knock a man senseless with a flick of your whip, and defy the laws of physics with your bulletry. You are the cowpoke.

Now for a new magical advanced class, one I have no idea on how to do perfectly, but I hope I did it justice.
WOTCH

Class Features
Soul Bow
At 1st level, the Quincy treats his bow as a holy weapon for purposes of damage.

Hollow Strike
At 2nd level, the Quincy hones his skills at taking down Hollows. He deals an added 1d6 points of energy damage to any undead classified as a Hollow. At 5th level, this increases to 2d6.

Bonus Feats

To regain them, he must be dealt at least 1d6 points of damage from an arrow shot 19mm away from his heart.

A new Advanced Class (thanks, J0lt).

THE NINJA

Pre-Vanishing and Post-Vanishing definitions of 'Ninja' are as far apart as the Grand Canyon. The Post-Vanishing view of the Ninja is defines by the Hidden Villages and countless amounts of mystical clans spread all over.

Those from before The Vanishing (and an astonishingly large number of Post-Vanishing Humans and even Fictions) see them as poseurs, depending greatly upon their Chakra (or Ki, or whatever) powers to achieve victory.

A Ninja specializes on stealth and ambushes. A Ninja is a skilled infiltrator and silent assassin, saboteur and spy. A Ninja uses deception and theatrics.

A Ninja, by Pre-Vanishing definition, is that who practices Ninjitsu. Post-Vanishing, this is the name that some take, but don't flaunt-a True Ninja does not has to.

Requirements
Skills: Hide 6 ranks, Move Silently 6 ranks.
Feats: Archaic Weapons Proficiency, Combat Martial Arts

Class Information
Hit Die
The ninja gains 1d6 hit points per level. The character’s Constitution modifier applies.

Action Points
The ninja gains a number of action points equal to 6 + half character level, rounded down every time she attains a new level in this class.

Class Skills
The ninja’s class skills are as follows.
Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Chemical) (Int), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (Earth and Life Sciences, Tactics, Theology and Philosophy) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), Read/Write Language (none), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Speak Language (none), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex)
Skill Points at Each Level: 7 + Int modifier.

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Ninja Advanced Class.

Living Weapon
The ninja attacks with either fist interchangeably, or even with elbows, knees, and feet. This means that the ninja may even make unarmed strikes when his or her hands are full, and there is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a ninja striking unarmed.
The ninja also deals more damage with unarmed strikes. At 1st level, the ninja deals 1d6 points of damage with an unarmed strike.
This is an increase to Combat Martial Arts damage; this has no effect on Brawl.

Atemi Strike
When an opponent is denied their Dex modifier to their AC, the ninja may make an attack with a light melee weapon, or any weapon which you could use with Weapon Finesse, including unarmed strike to a vital area to deal extra damage. This extra damage is +1d6 at 2nd level, it increases to +2d6 at 5th level and +3d6 at 8th level. Should the ninja score a critical hit with an atemi strike, this extra damage is not multiplied.
The ninja can not use this ability merely by flanking an opponent, they must either be flat-footed (unaware/unready for the attack), or otherwise unable to effectively defend themselves.
A ninja can not make an atemi strike that deals nonlethal damage with a weapon that normally deals lethal damage. If a weapon normally deals nonlethal damage (such as a Sap), then the atemi strike also deals nonlethal damage. A ninja may use his Combat Martial Arts/Living Weapon ability to make either lethal or nonlethal atemi strikes. The ninja must be considered "armed" to gain the benefits of this technique.

Uncanny Stealth
