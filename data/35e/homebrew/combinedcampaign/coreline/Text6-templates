Half-Immortal (Template)
Almost nothing is known about the mysterious EGSVerse Immortials, so it can be expected that the half-Immortals are a similar mystery. Nobody really knows how they come about or why and assumptions run high in those who actually know about them. Half-Immortals will have pastel-colored hair in colors such as pink, teal, or purple and will always have it in a fashion that is spiky. Half-Immorts also occasionally have pointy ears to a small extent. They also display some of the powers of their full-blooded "cousins."

Dunkle-Soldat (Dark-Soldier)

It had to happen sometime. As with every top-secret millitary project, details were eventually leaked about 'Project: Hellsoldier.' It doesn't matter who leaked the details, or why, but the general idea and blueprint were out on the open Black Market.

Millenium, the group of Neo-Nazis from the Hellsing-Verse, were the first to produce an actual working prototype of their own. The name of this project, Dunkle Soldat, stuck. By engineering a near-fatal car accident, they were able to obtain a subject to implment the project on. The identity of this person has been lost.

At any rate, Dunkle-Soldats are expensive, and often less-effective than Hellsoldiers. Nonetheless, they're considered the perfect weapon for every evil organization who can afford one.

Template: 'Dunkle-Soldat'
It can be added to any humanoid creature (refered to hereafter as the character). It uses the character's statistics and special abilities in addition to those descibed below.

-Saves: Same as the character, with a +1 bonus on Will and +2 on Ref. saves.
-Ability Scores: +2 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Con.
-Feats: The character gains the following feats if he meets the requirements, and didn't had them already: Ambidexterity, Cybertaker, Improved Initiative, Ultra Immune System.

"Shinigami" is an acquired template that can be added to any giant, humanoid or monstrous humanoid. The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) must have a Charisma score of at least 6.

A Shinigami uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Size and Type
The creature’s type changes to Outsider. Do not recalculate the creature’s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype. Size is unchanged.

Armor Class
Natural armor is the same as the base creature’s but applies only to ethereal encounters. It also gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is higher.

Special Attacks
A Shinigami retains all the special attacks of the base creature. It also gains the Zanpaktou special attack

Zanpaktou (Su)
The Shinigami can manifest a spiritual Katana (which they gain automatic proficiency with) from their own life essence as a free action. It deals damage as a normal Katana, but gains a bonus on attack and damage equal to their Charisma bonus.

Special Qualities
A ghost has all the special qualities of the base creature as well as those described below.

Abilities
Str +4; Dex +6; Con +2; Int +0; Wis +2; Cha +6;

Environment
Any, often as base creature.

Challenge Rating
Same as the base creature +4.

Level Adjustment
Same as the base creature +7.

And here are some changes that a friend said could be done to it:

Size and Type:
Outsider: +0
Incorporeal subtype: +2
Size change(none): +0

Armor Class:
Natural armor is the same as the base creature’s but applies only to ethereal encounters. It also gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is higher.
Might by +1, as this will (likely) be at least +3 AC.

Special Attacks:
Zanpaktou (Su)
Hmm, always ready 1d10 damage with (at least) a +3 to hit and damage bonus, definately more potent then normal 1-handed melee weapons, so that's a +1

Abilities:
Str +4; Dex +6; Con +2; Int +0; Wis +2; Cha +6;
First, WHY a STR bonus at all? Incorporeal creatures lack a STR score.
Aside from that, definately an unbalanced set of stat gains (+16 without the STR, definately at least a +1 here)

Level Adjustment (at present estimate):
Same as the base creature +5.

Spartan 1.0(template)

Ability Modifiers: +4 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Con, +2 Int.
Skill Modifiers: +2 to Balance, Climb, Drive, Jump, Listen, Pilot, Search, Spot. Swim and Tumble.
Uncanny Dodge: A Spartan automatically gains the Uncanny Dodge 1 Fast hero ability.
Spartan Rage: The physical and mental conditioning of a Spartan 1.0 causes problems in the return to civilian life and in non-combat situations. Since they are trained to constantly search for threats, and asses the ways to deal with them in combat, this tends to sometimes spill over into other stressful situations. At the DMs discretion, a Spartan must make a will save against 10+own BAB whenever the situation becomes stressful or attack uncontrollably the source of the stress. Sometimes this can happen for no apparent reason at all, such as walking down the aisle of a supermarket.
LA:+2
Spartan 1.0 is an acquired 'race' that is induced by excessive nanite and genetic enhancement. Although not as extensive or powerful as the Spartan 2.0 program, the cost of producing a 1.0 is much lower, and the time invested much smaller. However, the same risk of death is present for both procedures.
Spartan 1.0s have in the past after retirement actually married and had children. These children inherit at least some of their boosted parents abilities and are referred to as 1.1s unnoficially.

Spartan 1.1

Skill points, starting feats and occupations as Humans.
Ability Adjustments: +2 Str, +4 Dex, +2 Con, +2 Int
Skill Modifiers: +2 to Balance, Climb, Drive, Jump, Listen, Pilot, Search, Spot. Swim and Tumble.
LA: +2

Hidden [Template]
"Hidden" is a template that can be added to any corporeal creature with a defined body structure. A creature with the "Hidden" template is most likely the product of experimental biological experiments aiming to produce an "Active Camouflage" effect for military use. They are primarily ambush attackers, using their stealth skills to approach their target (or prey, in the case of non-sentient Hidden) and attack with brutal efficiency.

All of the base creature's stats stay the same with the following additions:

Speed: Increases by +10ft (2 squares)

Special Qualities:
Active Camouflage (Ex): The Hidden has the unique ability to go nearly or totally invisible. He has complete invisibility (as the spell) at any time he does not move or moves less than half his speed. If he moves any faster than this, his active camouflage drops to 50% concealment instead, though opponents can tell which square he is in. This camouflage is always active, and attacking does not cause him to become visible. He can carry a light load without any of the equipment becoming visible. Any more and it will appear, and give him away (10% concealment).

Substance dependence (Ex): The Hidden depends on some exotic (or not so exotic) chemical to survive. Each case is different - for some it's fresh, raw meat or blood, in others it's a synthetic chemical designed to keep them from 'going rogue'. GMs should decide on the exact chemical when creating the Hidden.
Treat this as a requirement in addition to normal food and water - use the d20 Modern rules for dehydration, unless the Hidden regularly consumes some of the substance, again, the amount required is up to the GM.

Darkvision (Ex): To 60ft range.

Skills: Hidden gain a +4 bonus to Hide checks.
Feats: The Hidden gains the Stealthy feat as a bonus feat.
CR adjustment: +1 (if base creature CR < PC's ECL) or +2 (base creature CR > PC's ECL)
Level Adjustment: +2

Lego Minifigure (Template)

Ah, the majestic Minifigure! A staple of all who play with Legos. Their odd little constantly-smiling faces, their fingerless hands, their shoes bulit into their pants! Who doesn't love minfigures?

Since the Lego corporation made fictional tales centering around their product, the Minifigures came into being after the Panic. They come from all walks of life, from today, to the far-flug future. From the Middle Ages to the heady days of piracy.

Minifigure Traits
Minifigures are constructs. They also share the following traits:

Size: Same as base speicies, though only small and medium may be played as PCs.

Speed: Same as base.

Abilitiy Scores: A minifigure has no constitution score and a starting charisma of 4. They may alter their mental (INT, CHA, WIS) as normal, but not strength or dexterity.

Occupation: Same as base.

Hit points: 1d10 per level. Otherwise, same as Base.

Incompatible: A Minifigure is incompatible with most items. They have no fingers, and no real joints. As such, all equipment must be specially-modified (Repair DC 13) to be used.

Nonleathal by Nature: A Minifigure is only capable of dealing leathal damage to other Minifigures. An attempt to deal leathal damage to anything else takes a -4 penalty.

Immunities: A Minifigure is immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralyisis, stunning, diease, necromancy effects, and all effects requiring a Fortitude save unless it targets inanimate objects as well. They cannot be raised from the dead.

Skills: As normal.

Feats: In addition to Simple Weapons Proficentcy, a Minifigure may also choose Archaic weapons, Personal Firearms, or Brawl.

Action Points: As normal.
