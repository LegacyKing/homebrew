#New Item: 
Kaleesh Huntsman's Mask	TYPE:Facewear	SPROP:Purchase DC 20 (off of the black market)
#This mask is designed from the skull of some ferocious beast killed by the wearer and is almost always worn by him or her. A Kaleesh huntsman's mask gives the wearer a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks. You can't buy a huntsman's mask in any legal circles since they are made by the hunter after his victory. For this reason and the fact that the only other real way would be to kill the maker and take the mask, Kaleesh will usually go for the throat of any non-Kaleesh wearing a huntsman's mask.

#New Weapon: Mustafarian Longrifle
#These weapons are designed to get past the exoskeletons of the Mustafarians since they resist the fiery sting of laser and blaster weapons. These guns are mostly carried by Northern Mustafarian security forces for protection but are sometimes purchased by military forces of other species. Longrifles are made from materials that are light enough to be easily carried by the weaker Northern Mustafarians.
