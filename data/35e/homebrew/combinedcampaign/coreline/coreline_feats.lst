Common Speaker	TYPE:Wookie	PREPCLEVEL:MAX=1			PRERACE:1,Wookie	BENEFIT:The Wookie's vocal cords have developed enough to speak languages other than Shyriiwook, but unfortunately, while they can understand it fully, they cannot speak it on their own. Normal - A Wookie cannot speak languages other than Shyriiwook, and if they decide to learn others, they must contain the same base language' (meaning growls, howls and other animal noises).

###Block: ----------------------
# Feat Name			Type												Required Skill		Description																											Description of the Benefits
Anti-Armor Saboteur	TYPE:General.Smart.Strong.Soldier.Infiltrator.HelixWarrior.FieldOfficer	PRESKILL:1,Demolition=3	DESC:You know how to exploit the weak spots of many mecha designs, employing explosives and personal weapons at close range to hit tiny flaws and delicate electronics.	BENEFIT:When attacking a mecha, you can ignore its hardness if you are within 12 meters of it. You cannot use this feat if you are in a mecha yourself because your sensors and weapons lack the precision to hit such tiny areas. If the mecha has forcefields and the like, they must be taken down first for the feat to work. SPECIAL - This is an extra feat for the Smart, Strong, Soldier, Infiltrator, Helix Warrior and Field Officer classes.

###Block: These others come from the D20 BESM book. The "Classes" note is a lousy attempt at determining who should get it. I'd appreciate help on that part.
# Feat Name			Type												Required Feat					Required Stat	Description																																																											Description of the Benefits
Judge Opponent		TYPE:General.Smart.Dedicated.MartialArtist															DESC:You have a knack to determine your opponent's condition and fighting ability.																																															BENEFIT:The character can judge his or her opponent's approximate Base Attack Bonus and weapon Skill Rank from the foe's attitude and posture even without actually seeing him or her fight. Additionally, the character can accurately estimate the opponent's remaining Hit Points. For both of these advantages, the GM may decide to provide descriptive indications such as "your enemy is much better than you with a sword, but if you connect a few times with your ki blast, it will drop him," rather than saying "the enemy's base attack bonus is +10, with a Melee Attack (Sword) Skill of 2, and he has 60 Hit Points remaining." -Special: This is an extra feat for the Smart, Dedicated, Martial Artist classes.
One Shot Left		TYPE:General																				DESC:Just like the Shotgun Catapult, the physics of the earth has changed to allow for the strange leeways that are common to movies and animation. For example, consider this one: either for very strict firing disciplines or sheer strange luck, your gun always has one shot left. It might not be a lot, but they're usually not expecting it.				BENEFIT:The character will always have at least one projectile remaining for his or her ranged weapon, even after an extended combat. This might be a final bullet in a gun, arrow in a quiver, plasma unit in a wrist blaster, or stone in a sling. This option does not remove the need to reload weapons in a game that uses realistic ammunition rules, but rather assures that the character will not be forced to reload at a critical moment. One Shot Left does not affect weapons with only one shot in their barrel to start with (like derringers) or special attacks.
Portable Armoury		TYPE:General																				DESC:Known in the lower circles with the wrongful term of "Mousse Syndrome", it is a knack by the character to pack a lot of gear and barely feel the weight. Unlike the Fiction character, however, this is not so much a "power" as it is an understanding that it's better to not need than not have-certainly they can't produce them out of thin air. Can they?	BENEFIT:The character will always have easy access to any weapon required for a particular task, including illegal weapons and accessories not available to the general public. The actual weapons and accessories must still be acquired as normal, but remarkably, the character can access them whenever he or she needs them instead of being forced to return to where they are normally stored. Characters with Portable Armoury may also make field modifications on their weapons, switching options such as laser sights or scopes in a single round.
Weapons Encyclopedia	TYPE:General.Smart.Fast.Gunslinger.Techie.Bodyguard.Infiltrator.Soldier								PRESTAT:1,INT=13	DESC:A bizarre knack your character has is a pretty large knowledge of everything lethal-blame it to gun nuttiness, lack of appropriate reading material, or the programming of the History Channel. What is certain is that if there's a gun out there, they'll know about it and what it can do. And maybe before the rest of the team.						BENEFIT:A character has the ability to recall the vital statistics and important quirks of practically all known commercially available weapons. This includes, but is not limited to, its general level of reliability as well as all vital statistics - material composition, ammunition capacity, calibre, possible outfitted accessories, etc. Characters without this ability will only have such information on weapons they actually own or use regularly and will need to successfully roll an Intelligence based Knowledge: Military Science (Hardware Recognition) Skill check to recall important details. In addition, Weapons Encyclopedia also includes knowledge on acquiring weapons, so characters will have a +4 bonus on any Knowledge: Streetwise or Knowledge: Business Skill checks needed to locate or buy weapons. -Special Extra Rule: If the GM rules it appropriate for the situation, they can allow the character with this feat to make extra rolls to determine specific guns by means other that sight-Listen rolls for hearing a gun's chambering give a bonus to Intelligence rolls to determine the gun based on how much it went over the DC, for example. -Special: This feat is available as an extra feat for Smart, Fast, Gunslinger, Techie, Bodyguard, Infiltrator and Soldier classes.
Rolling Shot		TYPE:General										PREFEAT:3,Point Blank Shot,Dodge,Mobility	PRESTAT:1,DEX=13	DESC:You are highly trained in acrobatic dodges while doing ranged combat.																																																BENEFIT:If you have declared you're moving while attacking (ranged weps only), you gain a +2 dodge bonus aganist other ranged attacks.
Blind-Shoot			TYPE:General.Gunslinger																			DESC:Your ability wielding guns is such, that you no longer need to see your opponent to know where to shoot.																																										BENEFIT:The character suffers half penalties associated with attacking with ranged weapons in poor light, absolute darkness, or aganist an invisible opponent. This feat can be assigned twice to reduce the penalty to zero. The PC must be capable of detecting the general presence of his target, however, through one of his or her senses (smel, hearing, etc). -Special: Gunslingers can take this as an extra feat. Blind-Shoot only works for ranged combat, melee requires Blind-Fight.

###Block: Homebrews
# Feat Name					Unique Key					Type											Req. Att.	Required Feat										Required Skill				Required Stat	Required Text	Description																																																																																																																		Combat bonus			Bonus to skill						Description of the Benefits
Hip Shot											TYPE:General.Gunslinger								PREATT:3	PREFEAT:1,Quick Draw															PRESTAT:1,DEX=15				DESC:You watch too many cowboy movies and learned to shot at the moment you draw your gun by using your hip and waist to direct your attack.																																																																																																									BENEFIT:You may attack at the moment you draw your weapon. This attack is made with a -2 to hit. This weapon must be Small or Medium in size. Special: Gunslingers can take this as an extra feat.
Blooded											TYPE:General																																			DESC:You know what it means to fight for your life and the value of quick wits and quicker reactions when danger is near. Enemies find it difficult to catch you off guard.																																																																																							BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|2	BONUS:SKILL|Spot|2					BENEFIT:You gain a +2 on Initiative checks and a +2 bonus on Spot checks.
Shotgun Catapult										TYPE:General									PREATT:1	PREFEAT:1,Personal Firearms Proficiency																		DESC:In the Post-Virus world, there's no such thing as "standard" physics. You know that... and they've learned the HARD way. Cliches like this one happen every day, and a good deal of shootouts have ended with people flying around like rag dolls.																																																																																							BENEFIT:If you manage to roll a critical while firing a shotgun, roll as normal. The target is not only damaged as normal, but is also thrown in the general direction of the shot 2d6 meters. The target can recieve additional damage by colliding with any hazards during his flight. This ability can target enemies that are normally immune to critical hits, if they're the same size or are smaller than the character.
Boomer Bullets										TYPE:General.Strong.Tough.Fast.Gunslinger.HelixWarrior.Soldier			PREFEAT:1,Shotgun Catapult																				DESC:One of the many deviations of common physics that happen on movies is that bullets can create massive explosions or minor fireworks with no additional modification-firing thru oil barrels or gas tanks and making them explode, striking sparks by firing at the pavement or body armor, to mention some examples. This deviation is one thing that has appeared thru the CLULESS Virus, and people with this feat are masters in its application. Be it for some rather extreme shooting training, some secret 'gun fu' ki technique, or plainly having seen too many bad action movies and thinking 'it's worth a try', the fact is that when they fire, things are more bound to go 'boom' than usual.														BENEFIT:The effect of 'boomer bullets' must be declared at the beginning of the turn and activated with an action point. If you shoot at a target with a chance of exploding or catching on fire and it has a chance to roll a save, it can do so with the received damage as its DC. If it can't, then it is affected as usual. The 'boomer bullets' effect only works during your turn and turns off at the next one, but you can turn it on again by using another action point. Other weapon feats (like Strafe) allows you to affect an area rather than a single target, on which case all objects in the area can do as mentioned. This effect only affects the target once per turn (hitting them twice in the same round won't blow them up any higher). -SPECIAL: This feat is available as an extra feat for Strong, Tough, Fast, Gunslinger, Helix Warrior and Soldier classes.
False Identity										TYPE:General											PREFEAT:1,Hidden Identity																				DESC:You aren't you, not in the records, anyway.																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:In addition to not having official records of your existence, you have a solid alternate identity, complete with an authentic birth certificate, a driver's license, passport, Social Security card, and maybe a GED certificate. These are not forgeries, they're the real thing, legitimately filed, part of "the system", and this identity will stand up to all but the strictest scrutiny (where it will show up that no-one renembers you ANYWHERE.)
Hidden Identity										TYPE:General																																			DESC:You don't officially exist.																																																																																																																											BENEFIT:No record of you exists anywhere in any database. Your fingerprints, DNA, retinal and facial scans aren't on file in any civil, law enforcement, military or intelligence system, you cannot be tied to any Social Security number or birth certificate. This feat does NOT makes you permanently invisible to "the system". You may lose the benefits of this feat thru in-game actions that will have records of your DNA, fingerprints, or other kinds of information entered into official records in a way that can be clearly tied to you instead of just being an "unidentified subject". This feat also confers sufficient fraudulent documents that you can present-a driver's license, passport, or other official ID-and can use them to obtain a bank account and engage in other kinds of day-to-day activities. The DC to note these forgeries is 20. SPECIAL: This feat can only be taken during 1st Level without restriction. Taking it at any other moment requires in-game actions to eradicate all existing records.
Rapid Aim											TYPE:General									PREATT:8																									DESC:You have trained long and hard in the firing ranges, and so you can aim extremely rapidly.																																																																																																																	BENEFIT:The character can aim with a ranged weapon as a standard action.
Run Like Your Tail's On Fire!		KEY:Run Like Your Tails on Fire	TYPE:General																																			DESC:Constant less-than-healthy encounters during the 23 Hours (or a desire to avoid them) have given you a good reason to 'run for it' better than the rest.																																																																																																						BENEFIT:Your base speed increases by 3 meters. Additionally, your speed multiplier when sprinting multiplies by 1. This ability accumulates with other speed-increasing abilities.
Armed To The Teeth									TYPE:General											PREFEAT:1,Two Weapon Fighting																				DESC:You can fight two-handed with melee and ranged weapons.																																																																																																																						BENEFIT:When you fight with two weapons, you can use a ranged weapon in one hand and a melee weapon in the other hand. Normal: To gain the benefit of the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, both of your weapons must be ranged or melee.
Hard-Eyed					KEY:Hard Eyed				TYPE:General																							PRESKILL:1,Intimidate=4			PRESTAT:1,CHA=13				DESC:With a weapon in your hand, you have a have an especially dangerous aspect.																																																																																																																			BENEFIT:You gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks when aiming a firearm at the target of your check. The target must be within 30 feet and must be able to see you (and your firearm). The target does not have to be flat-footed. This bonus does not stack with the +2 circumstance bonus your GM might grant for threatening your target with a gun, but it can stack with other bonuses. Normal: Circumstances such as holding a gun on a flat-footed opponent normally grants a +2 bonus.
High Ready											TYPE:General											PREFEAT:1,Reactive Shooter														PRESTAT:1,DEX=13				DESC:Like a SWAT officer, you are accustomed to moving with your gun at the ready, shifting your aim with your sight.																																																																																																													BENEFIT:You can use the Reactive Shooter feat with a Large weapon. To do so, you must first have stated that your are at the 'high ready' position (on your feet, with your weapon shouldered, ready to fire). You can only move at half speed while prepared in this matter.
Guns Akimbo											TYPE:General											PREFEAT:1,Two Weapon Fighting																				DESC:You are skilled at delivering massive firearms attacks while on the move.																																																																																																																			BENEFIT:If you have two weapons, as an attack action you can make one attack with each weapon.

Normal: Attacking with two weapons is a full attack and requires a full action.
Improved Autofire										TYPE:General											PREFEAT:2,Personal Firearms Proficiency,Advanced Firearms Proficiency													DESC:You lay down withering barrages of autofire with deadly precision.																																																																																																																					BENEFIT:When you use autofire, the DC for the Reflex save is increased by +5. This ability stacks with other modifiers (ability-given or otherwise) to the save.
Hail Of Bullets										TYPE:General											PREFEAT:2,Point Blank Shot,Double Tap																		DESC:Your trigger finger is quick enough to unleash rains of fire.																																																																																																																					BENEFIT:You can use semi-automatic firearms as if they were automatic firearms. You can make autofire attacks and use feats that require autofire settings, like Burst Fire. You must meet all other requirements for the attack (like having enough ammo left).
Reactive Shooter										TYPE:General																													PRESTAT:1,DEX=13				DESC:You can react instantly with a firearm.																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:If you have a Medium-size or smaller ranged weapon in hand, you may act in the surprise round even if you are surprised. You can roll initiative as if you were not surprised. The only action you can take in the surprise round, however, is a single ranged attack with the weapon in your hand. You make this attack with your highest attack bonus, but with a -5 penalty on the attack. You are still considered flat-footed for all other purposes. Normal: If you were surprised during the beginning of combat, you can't take any action during the surprise round.
Supressive Fire										TYPE:General											PREFEAT:1,Personal Firearms Proficiency												PRESTAT:1,WIS=13				DESC:You can lay down a barrage of suppressive fire, giving you the chance to hit your opponent even when it's not your turn.																																																																																																												BENEFIT:When you attack a target that is at least 30 feet away with a semi-automatic or automatic firearm, you threaten the target's square until your next action (if using autofire, you threaten the targeted 10-foot-by-10-foot area). You can make ranged attacks of opportunity into that square. Suppresive fire shoots five bullets (in addition to the five bullets fired in your attack and any attack of opportunity), and can only be used if the weapon has five bullets in it.

Swift Strike										TYPE:General									PREATT:5																			PRESTAT:1,DEX=13				DESC:You are able to use a melee weapon extremely fast at the loss of precision.																																																																																																																			BENEFIT:When using a melee weapon, you're able to make an extra attack each round at your highest base attack bonus.

Lightning Two-Weapon Fighting		KEY:Lightning Two Weapon Fighting	TYPE:General									PREATT:4	PREFEAT:1,Two-Weapon Fighting														PRESTAT:1,DEX=13				DESC:You move with almost demonic speed when fighting with two weapons or a double weapon.																																																																																																																	BENEFIT:You are able to use an off-hand weapon or a double weapon to make the extra attack action as a simple attack action instead of a full attack action.

######################
# Feat Name					Unique Key			Type		Required Feat					Required Skill				Required Stat	Required Text					Description																																								Description of the Benefits
Small Size									TYPE:Toon																								DESC:Some Toons are pretty damn tiny.																																			BENEFIT:The character is one size smaller than the average member of his species. Adjust stats for the new size normally. Special: A character can take this feat more than once.
Hey, Cut It Out				KEY:Hey Cut It Out	TYPE:Toon	PREFEAT:1,Confident										PRESTAT:1,CHA=15+								DESC:You don't only make people hesitate on their actions, you look at them in the eye and stop them cold. Or more like squint them in the eye, whatever.																BENEFIT:This action is activated with an Action Point.

However, this bonus can only be used to make the target 'cut it out' (stop attacking, using a gadget, talking or other actions). On the following action, the target can make any other action, but he's shaken for purposes of trying to continue the activity you told them to 'cut out'.
Comedic Timing								TYPE:Toon								PRESKILL:2,Escape Artist=4,Bluff=4											DESC:You're a master at odd times, to make people laugh, to get into a situation, or to get OUT of it.																								BENEFIT:The character can perform an action impossible for a normal human, as long as it is done in a humorous manner. This includes painting holes, removing handcuffs, and the like - all subject to the player's imagination and GM's patience. If something makes the latter laugh, it should probably be allowed. Special- This feat cannot be used to obtain a tactical benefit during combat, unless a character uses it to retreat.
Comedic Weapon of Opportunity						TYPE:Toon	PREFEAT:1,Comedic Timing																			DESC:No matter where you go, rest assured that you'll have a nice variety of weapons at arm's reach, like a pie. Or a banana. Or the ever-reliable anvil.																BENEFIT:The character can obtain a 'weapon of opportunity' from the surrounding environment, at the GM's call. This 'weapon of opportunity' must be used in a comedic fashion, can only make subdual damage (regardless of what it is), and standard proficiency rules apply. Aside from that, it's fair game.
Exit Stage Right								TYPE:Toon																								DESC:'Walls don't make a prison' and you know how to leave it with grace.																													BENEFIT:The character can make a hole through a wall or other barrier as a means for quick escape. Special- The hole takes the same shape as the toon's normal form.

Slow Faller									TYPE:Toon																								DESC:A common gag is to have the Toon standing on the air for a second before he looks down and falls.

BENEFIT:Whenever the character is in danger of a fall that may cause falling damage, he spends one round suspended in midair before the fall begins. Other characters may attempt to prevent the fall which begins as normal in the next round.
Midair Scramble								TYPE:Toon	PREFEAT:1,Slow Faller																				DESC:Usually, after looking down, the Toon will try to run for the nearest ledge.

Prehensile Appendage							TYPE:Toon	PREFEAT:1,Sensitive Appendage									PRESTAT:1,DEX=13																																																	BENEFIT:The sensitive appendage is flexible enough to hold normal objects and use them as if they were held in a hand. Weapons fired behind a toon or around corners suffer the usual penalties for blind fighting. Special- Toons with a Strong, Prehensile appendage can hold Large objects.
Strong Appendage								TYPE:Toon	PREFEAT:1,Sensitive Appendage									PRESTAT:1,STR=13																																																	BENEFIT:The sensitive appendage is exceptionally strong, adding +5 to any Strength checks to resist dislodgement or Break checks. Special- Toons with a Strong, Prehensile appendage can hold Large objects.
Extensible Appendage							TYPE:Toon	PREFEAT:1,Sensitive Appendage									PRESTAT:1,INT=13																																																	BENEFIT:The sensitive appendage can extend up to 15 feet away from the Toon. All activities that can be done with the appendage are done as normal, although some others (like grappling) require an additional ranged touch attack roll. Special- Toons with a Strong, Prehensile appendage can hold Large objects.
Detachable Appendage							TYPE:Toon																																																																	BENEFIT:The Toon can detach a part of his body and 'remote operate' it from a short distance. The distance is 20 feet and as long as the Toon can concentrate, the appendage can perform actions as normal. This requires a Concentration check on part of the Toon, the GM has a final call on what can and can't be done and how hard it is (using a computer with a detached hand would require the Toon to be able to see the action, for example). Special- The Detachable Appendage need not necessarily to be the same as the other feats (a toon can have detachable eyes, for example, or could consider a glove an 'appendage' for this feat's ends). The GM has a final call on what can be applied to this feat.
King Size									TYPE:Toon																								DESC:Some Toons are just too large for their birches.																																	BENEFIT:The character is one size larger than the average member of his species. Adjust stats for the new size normally. Special- A character can take this feat more than once.
