CORELINE HUMANS:
They're "meats", "terrans", "monkey-boys", whatever. They're like you: two arms, two legs, opposing thumbs. Look at yourself in the mirror if you still need more. They were here before the Vanishing, they were here after the Vanishing, and they'll be out there forever.
What you don't know is that some MIGHT have a liiiiiitttle thing in difference.
RACIAL TRAITS:
-Post-Vanishing Human:
*As per the rulebook, additional +1 to Wealth.

-Pre-Vanishing Human:
*As per rulebook, with these exceptions:
* Uses next higher die for rolling starting hit points (1d4>1d6>1d8>1d10>1d12)
* Has an additional +4 to any saving throws to any magic attacks. Has a -4 penalty to use any magic.

FICTIONS

(Colonial) Remnant Humans:


They come from the universes of “Battlestar Galactica”. They are the last of the once-proud 12 Colonies of Kobol, on the run and on the search of the fabled 13th Colony- the shining blue planet we call “Earth”. It was written on their scriptures that it was a sort of paradise, and after the destruction of their homeworlds, it’s their only hope left.
They are here, and they discovered quite quickly that this was anything but a freakin’ paradise. They have no place else to go, and so, must adapt.
All of a sudden, the threat of the Cylons is the LEAST of their problems.
Racial Traits:
Remnant Humans are as per the rulebook, with these exceptions:
*They hate Cylons A LOT: +1 (or +2) to any attack roll involving robots (this adds up to any other thing, like the "Down With Robots" ability of the D20F Technosavant). Role-playing-wise, they're very paranoid around robots and A.I.s.
*"If we let them escape, they'll become stronger and come back for revenge. It's in their nature.": A Remnant Human obtains a +1 to any rolls involving rallying Remnant Humans. Charismatic heroes are due to squeeze the life out of this one.
*"Yes, we're tired. Yes, there's no relief. Yes, the Cylons keep coming after us time, after time, after time-and yes, we're still expected to DO OUR JOBS!":The Remnant Human has a +2 bonus to rolls to avoid exhaustion due to lack of sleep, or sleep-creating effects. Some of them are chronic insomniacs.
*"Hurry up, people! We have only 32 minutes left!": Choosing to climb up the difficulty one step, a Remnant Human can do any kind of repair roll or jury-rigging in half the time (minimum of 30 minutes). If something cannot be battle-ready in 30 minutes or less, they're prone to ditch it.

-Kryyn (aka Kryn):


The Kryn are a race of anthropomorphs. They are feline-looking in appearance, although they have long-ago "outgrown" some of their most "animal" characteristics. Their only settlement on Earth is a long-ago -crashed cityship in Peru, which has evolved the fable of El Dorado. They have little contact with the exterior.
Racial Traits:
*+2 Dex, -2 Wis: Kryn are very stealthy and have a good sense of balance. Recluded upbringing, however, makes them somewhat naive considering Earth stuff.
*Medium-sized.
*Base speed of 30 Feet.
*+2 racial bonus on Listen, Climb and Run Silent checks: Necessity to avoid humans has giver Kryn a reason to try and be undetected.

-Perryverse Atlanteans:


This particular version of Atlanteans come from the mind of Fred Perry and his "Gold Digger" universe. They live in (duh) Atlantis, a city-ship buried under the Atlantic Ocean (from the same planet as the Kryn). Up until recently, Atlantis and El Dorado were at war.
-Appearance: They look humanish in appearance, except that their skin is silver/greenish, and have gills and elf-like ears. Hair tends to be silverish, greenish, or blue, looking more like fine metal strands than hair. And on their forearms they have fin-like razors, warriors having extremely long and sharp ones. They can live above and below water.
Racial Traits:
*+1 Con, +1 Str, -2 Dex: Atlanteans are very resilient, but not very agile, at least on land (NOTE: Negatives don't apply to Atlanteans while underwater in the comic, GM decision, though).
*Medium-sized.
*Base speed of 30 feet, swim of 50 feet.
*Blindsight 20 feet: All Atlanteans have a developed sense of echolocation, enabling them to go thru the waters surrounding their city with no problem. They can also use the echolocation to communicate with each other.
*Breathe Underwater: As amphibious creatures, Atlanteans can't drown in water. They also have a +4 species bonus on Swim checks. However, they have a -4 on saves aganist heat.
*Fin-Like Razors: Located on each forearm, these are the Atlanteans' main weapons. Short ("Commoner") versions do 1d4 Slashing damage, while long ("Warrior") versions do 2d6 Slashing damage. Feats and class features that affect weapon damage (Like the D20M Soldier's Weapon Focus/Specialization) can be taken for them.

Half Giant
*+2 Strength, +2 Constitution, -2 Dexterity: Half-giants are tough and strong, but not too nimble.
*Giant: Half-giants are not subject to spells or effects that affect only humanoids, such as charm person or dominate person.
*Medium: As Medium creatures, half-giants have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
*Half-giant base land speed is 30 feet.
*Low-Light Vision: A half-giant can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
*Powerful Build: The physical stature of half-giants lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Whenever a half-giant is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject's size category.
*Level Adjustment: +1. (maybe. What do you think?)

From "Fallout":
DEATHCLAWS:


These huge, bipedal monsters were derived and created from chameleons. They were created by an unknown faction as shock troops, but for some reason (one can only assume the Vanishing), they were never used and set free. They are subdivided in two main factions with a few offshoots, and so far, are mostly found in North America, although a very few have wandered into other lands, like Central America, Russia and Canada. Deathclaws are one of the fastest and strongest creatures you will find around the Americas.
These stats are based on their main two factions.
-Eastern Deathclaws: They are located on small encampments all over the East Coast up to Maine. They are more human-like in some ways that their Western cousins, bigger and stronger, although they’re not quite as smart, they have founded a cohesive culture.
They stand between 12 and 14 feet tall, with claws a foot long or more.
*+6 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Con, -2 Int, -4 Cha.
*Large-Sized: As Large-sized creatures, Eastern Deathclaws have a -1 AC penalty for their size, but gain a +15 natural AC. They can wear no armor, and can wield no weapons other than their natural weapons.
*Damage Reduction 10/-
*Darkvision 60 feet
*Deathclaw base speed is 60 feet.
*Natural Weapons: Claws: 4d8, Bite: 3d8. A Deathclaw adds his Str bonus to this damage. Deathclaws cannot wield any weapons, but can take any weapon-enhancing feats/class features for their natural weapons.
*Improved Grab: If a Deathclaw hits with both claw attacks, it may latch on to an enemy and make bite attacks with an additional bonus of +4. The held creature takes 2d8 points of damage from the claws every round.
*Ram: Deathclaws may charge an enemy and deal 4d6+10 damage with their horns without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the enemy is two or more sizes smaller than the Deathclaw, it may also trample for 3d6 damage.
*Frightening Appearance: Deathclaws receive a +10 circumstance bonus to Intimidate rolls against non-Deathclaws of the same size or smaller.
*Level Adjustment: +5

*Western Deathclaws: Stationed on small villages all over the Americal Southwest and the West Coast out to Alaska, the Western Deathclaws are actually smaller, faster and smarter than their Eastern cousins, and some have managed to make a place for themselves on places like Las Vegas and Denver, hiring out their services as bodyguards, bouncers, or strong-arms.
They stand between 8 and 10 feet tall, with 6 to 10-inch-long claws.
Stats-wise, they are the same as the Eastern Deathclaws, except for the following:
*Large-Sized: As Large-sized creatures, Western Deathclaws have a -1 AC penalty for their size, but gain a +10 natural AC. They can wear no armor, and can wield no weapons other than their natural weapons, or weapons that augment their natural weapons.
*Damage Reduction: 6/-.

“GHOULS”:


One thing is for sure: not everybody who is exposed to radiation gets off lucky. These people didn’t got off, even if they DID survived. “Ghouls” had their DNA was mutated to an unknown extent by the nuclear and biological WMDs of their home dimension, making their lifespan extremely long. The mutation, unfortunately, was not without a price. For all extents and purposes, the “ghouls” look like the undead. Their skin peels off and festers, sores and tumors cover their desiccated bodies, and they shuffle slowly. For all this, the mutation and their own expanded lifespans have made them fearfully intelligent and keen-sensed.
“Ghouls” are the shunned of the Earth, and they accept this fact. They have formed ghettoes and towns for their own, and if they need to go out, they make a point of covering fully. They will NEVER go to London if they can help it (or else Hellsing might get 'em just on principle). Living year after year in a nearly-dead body has made more than one resentful, and so will hold their trust from normal people until it is earned.
They are divided into two factions: the “normal” Ghouls, and the less-numbered “Glowing Ones”.
-“Normal” Ghouls: This is your “standard” Ghoul. They are not strong physically, but are dreadfully sharp in many cases. They tend to go for less stressful positions, such as doctors, advisors, techs or merchants.
TRAITS:
*+2 Wis, +2 Int, -2 Con, -2 Str.
*Medium-Sized.
*Speed 20 ft.
*+1 to Spot and Search checks.
*Rad-Resistant: Ghouls gain a +5 to any rolls involving radiation resistance, completely ignore the damage on a successful save, and halve said damage on a failed save.

-“Glowing Ones”: A few poor unfortunate Ghouls were so close to the WMD blasts that they were “infected” with residual radiation that will stay for years to come. They are called “Glowing Ones” because at night they glow very dimly from the residual radiation. They are just like normal Ghouls, except they’re a little less intelligent and can create radiation poisoning by their touch. The Glowing Ones are very dim, prone to wild mood swings, and the awareness that they can’t get close to normal creatures without making them harm makes them feel desperately lonely.
They are just like normal Ghouls, except for these adjustments:
*+2 Wis, -2 Str, -2 Cha.
*Medium-Sized.
*Speed 20 ft.
*Radioactive: Glowing Ones emit Low radiation within a 5-foot radius of himself. Upon striking a target unarmed, a Glowing One emits a burst of radiation of Moderate strength. (see Radiation Sickness rules in D20F). They usually buy anti-radiation suits to wear around normal people.
-Level Adjustment: +2.

APES:


Hailing from a parallel dimension that had monkeys develop advanced cognitive capabilities on par with humans’ (and then declaring us their pets), the apes are pretty much a reflection of us-that is, if we were (or still were) like them. They use guns. They have cities. They have a government.
They just don’t like us “damn, dirty humans”.
For all means and purposes, there are only two playable classes of ape: the Chimpanzee, which is the most “normal” of the two, and the Gorilla, who is used more normally as a “heavy trooper”.
-Chimpanzees:
*+2 Dex, -2 Int.
*Medium-Sized.
*They start with the Alertness feat
*They have the Scent ability.
*Bite attack of 1d6+1 damage.
*Speed of 30 ft (40 when moving on all fours). Climb speed of 30 ft.

-Gorillas:
*+4 Str, -2 Int, Wis and Cha.
*Large-Sized.
*They start with the Alertness feat.
*They have the Scent ability.
*Bite attack of 1d6+2, Claw attack (?) of 1d6+5.
*Speed of 25 ft (35 when moving on all fours). Climb speed of 30 ft.


Based on a D&D write-up by Damien Crowley (modified by me):

THUNDERIAN


The Royal Guard & Lord Lion-O, ready to rock.

This race comes from an Animate Fiction universe, most probably one from some 80’s series (which would explain their ‘goody-two-shoes’ personalities). Their home planet was destroyed in a cataclysmic explosion, and they have wandered all over the place looking for a new home. At the time of the Vanishing, apparently, they have received a beacon signal from their Royal Guard, guiding them to said new home (funny thing, they say, that it’s where their home planet used to be), when they appeared in orbit over Coreline.
They have established themselves all over Coreline on places that resemble their planet, which include Africa, Asia and the jungles of Central America. Their society is based on a code of honor that enforces trust, peacefulness, loyalty and fighting evil whenever it is found. Although peaceful by nature (and strangely lacking in enemies), they can get to be very vicious when fighting a foe, like the felines they resemble (and evolved from).
They are a race of anthropomorphic felines, and as such, there’s often jokes made at their backs that they might be distant relatives of the Kryn.

RACIAL TRAITS:
*Medium Humanoids.
*Base speed is 30 feet.
*+2 Strength & Dexterity, -2 Wisdom. Thunderians are very strong & dexterous but they tend to be overly curious & prone to trouble.
*Improved Low-light Vision:Thunderians can see four times as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, & similar conditions of poor illumination. They retains the ability to distinguish color & detail under these conditions.
*+2 Spot & Listen checks. A Thunderian has naturally keen senses.
*+2 Climb & Jump & Move silently checks. Thunderian’s retractable claws aid in climbing & they are naturally stealthy & athletic like the great cats they are descended from.
*+2 to Survival checks. Thunderians are naturally at home in the wilderness.
*Scent ability. Thunderians have a highly sensitive sense of smell.
*Natural attacks: 1d4 (x2). Thunderians have retractable claws on their hands & feet that aid in climbing & they are often used in combat.
*Thundrilium Vulnerability: Thunderians are assumed to be one step higher when rolling for effects of Radiation Sickness on exposure to Thundrillium (see D20 Future, pg. 81).
Although this is an extremely rare element (and it didn’t even existed Pre-Vanishing on Coreline), several Thunderian devices are powered by it, and its gold by-product has become the seed for a slight (but damaging) gold rush.
*Effective Level: +1.
(NOTE: Although the write-up is fully based on the ‘Thundercats’ series, it is my belief that the abilities shown by the series Thundercats (who are the Royal Guard, BTW) are both the result of training and (limtedly) mutation, or at least that's how it shows on one of the Wildstorm comics.
Consider this a 'base' Thunderian racial stat).

SPACE ONI


Princess Lum in royal military uniform (and, yeah, it doesn't protects a lot).

They are the (obnoxious) children of the imagination of Rumiko Takahashi, an alien race that is war-wacky, conquering, annoying, advanced in technology, powerful and numerous. Like all Takahashi characters, they are a walking bundle of contradictions that is funny to watch-from a safe distance.

A Space Oni looks a lot like a human, sizing in average between 5 and 6 1/2 feet tall and weighting (at a max) about 200 pounds. Their mouths sport elongated canines and two small horns protude from their heads. A Space Oni sporting clothes "typical" to the race always wears clothes with tiger stripes, giving them an appearance like the Japanese monsters of legend.
A Space Oni sports a natural curiosity and stubborness, defending their beliefs (whichever they are) with excessive zealotry. A loved one, a parking spot, their position in a company... they will just as soon draw a gun and destroy a threat to it, to talk (in earnest) for it.

An Oni possesses tactile, olfactory, visual and listening capabilities on par with a normal human's. They are slightly stronger, a lot tougher, somewhat dumber and less 'sharp' than a normal human, and many (if not all) are capable of unassisted flight and throwing energy bolts (fire or electricity).
The Space Oni speak their own language and can speak other languages as well. Their own language is guttural in nature.

Space Oni society has evolved in leaps and bounds, having developed hyperspace travel and expanding to 9 more worlds (all of them conquered) well before humans, at least on their home universe.

RACIAL TRAITS:
*Medium-Sized Humanoids.
*Base Speed 30 Feet.
*+2 Str, +3 Con, +1 Cha, -2 Int, -2 Wis.
*Flight: The Oni can fly thru an unknown means of unassisted flight (it's believed to be a primitive kind of telekinesis-and certainly they don't know how to apply it to anything else). They can fly at a base speed of 60 feet (Average maneuverability), but can hover and have no minimum forward speed.
*Blast: The Oni grow special gangliae on their bodies, enabling them to fire energy blasts at will. At the time of the Vanishing, only two variants of blast are known: fire blasts (thru the combination of two chemicals in the mouth), and electricity blasts (thru sub-dermal 'pouches' and a highly conductive skin).
An Oni can only have one of the two.
Fire blasts do 2d4 (fire) damage, critical range 20, with a width of 3 feet and a 50-foot range. Tarrgets hit with this blast can catch on fire as standard. It is useless underwater.
Electricity blasts do 2d6 damage (Electricity), same critical range, with a range 100 feet. It is influenced by conductivity and bypasses thru metal with ease, making it ignore metal armor (do not count such for Defense purposes).
It can also be thrown as a sphere at will, affecting EVERYONE within. a 20-foot-radius sphere around the Oni. This deals 1d4 of subdual damage to the Oni, however.
These blasts can be thrown once per day per character level.
*Alien Constitution: Oni get a +2 bonus to resist diseases and poisons, except extremely rare, engineered or unusual ones (they get drunk on pickle juice, for example).
*Horns: For some unknown reason (most probably just the Author's whim), if you can remove an Oni's horns, they lose their powers. This requires a called shot (-4 penalty, because it's a small target), and it takes a minimum of 5 days for the horns to grow back on their own.



YUKI-ONNA.

Princess Oyuki.

-Another species created by Rumiko Takahashi, however, we only ever see one member of it on her works: Princess Oyuki.
On their home universe, this species comes from Neptune, and with their innate cold powers, long life, somewhat cold demeanor and occasional visits to Earth, may have helped create the legend of the Japanese "Snow Woman".
-A 'Yuki-Onna' is always female, sizing in average some 5 1/2 feet tall, with hair and eyes in all sorts of color, but always in 'cold' tones. 'Common' clothes for them vary widely in private, but in public they always tend to wear a modernized kimono, again giving them an appearance like the monsters of legend.
-A Yuki-Onna sports a quality of constant calm around her. Contrary to popular belief, they are not 'cold-hearted', but it's because of the fact that they believe in maintaining their cool at any given moment to be highly beneficial.
-Yuki-Onnas posess tactile, olfactory, visual and listening capabilities on par with a normal human's. They are naturally 'prettier', slightly more coordinated, sharper and calmer.
Their physiologies can withstand any cold (but take heat pretty badly), and can manipulate it up to a point (by unknown means, but it's believed to be a sort of preternatural cryokinesis).
-Yuki-Onnas speak their own language, but can speak any humanoid language. Their own language consists of low whistles and windy sighs.
-Yuki-Onna society is matriarchal and high-tech in nature (they use Stargates to move around), friendly to the Onis (they are their accountants). Apart from that, they maintain their neutrality.
RACIAL TRAITS:
*Medium-sized humanoids.
*+2 Int, +2 Wis, +2 Cha.
*Cold Subtype: Yuki-Onnas are immune to cold, but take double damage from fire (except on a successful save).
*Paralyzing Gaze (Su): If looks could kill, a Yuki-Onna's would be a cold grave. As is, it's still freezing. This is similar to a gaze attack, except the Yuki-Onna must take a standard action, and those merely looking at it are not affected. Anyone the Yuki-Onna targets must succeed on a Will save (DC 18) or be affected as though by a "Hold Person" spell. The ability has a range of 30 feet.
*A Yuki-Onna's pseudo-cryokinesis enables the Yuki-Onna to fire condensed blasts of cold at will. These blasts do 2d6 (Cold) damage, critical range 20. Living targets hit must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC: Damage recieved) or suffer 1 point of temporal Dex damage.
It can make inanimate objects brittle; it only does half damage aganist most materials (not made for cold conditions), but ignores hardness altogether. Under conditiond of extreme heat (e.g. a desert); it doesn't works as well: the blast only does 1d6. Finally, if it is fired to a level surface, that surface becomes slippery.
This can be fired once per day per character level.
*They gain Read/Write Yuki-Onna and Speak Yuki-Onna as free languages.

SOLNOIDS

'The Gall(ant) Force', a Solnoid Navy special team (although this specific bunch never called themselves that, some other special assault teams formed from time to time basing themselves on them have taken the name), with Solnoid 'Bronx'-Class Large Mechas in the background.

This Fiction race is what you could call "Kenichi Sonoda's vision of Space Valkyries", and it existed on its home universe a rough three million years before modern times.
They were in a war that would end badly, aganist another alien species called the Paranoid (the best way to describe them would be 'ooze-borgs'), when both species leaders pulled out their 'final option' (system-destroying weapons) and fired regardless of whoever stood in the way.
They were believed to be extinct in the battle on the (now-destroyed) Sigma Marse system, but like any good human species, they refused to die out.
The Vanishing made a small number of them appear on Coreline orbit, and have since settled down all over it and the Colonies, especially in positions like UNSC, F-SWTI and corporations.
It is of notice that former Solnoid Intelligence chief Catty Nebulart is the new UNSC chief, following the deposition of Chief Pablochiva.

-Description: The entire Solnoid race is female humans, with a population maintained thru constant cloning. A good way to describe them would be "Space Amazons", just more 'realistic'. Virtually any way to describe a female applies to a Solnoid.
-Solnoid society is matriarchal in nature, with a 'Leader' in the role of CINC. The Solnoid military is split in three parts: Intelligence, Navy and Attackers (Marines/Air Force). They fight, one and all, even if some are brainier, clumsier and/or more pacifist, the last thing you should think is that they won't fight if required.
-Solnoids revere a goddess known only as "The Great Mother". It is rumored that it's an aspect of Nike or Hecate.
-Solnoids are a space-faring race with advanced medical, vehicular, robotics and weapon technology. Roughly speaking, weapons tech goes from (modified) PL5 to early 6, medical tech goes and spaceships are 7 (FTL is not experimental, but it's also not that much safe technology). Cybernetics are 7, but any cyborg in the Solnoid military is part of a conscript army. Their robotic tech as a whole is classified, but it's known that they have Bioreplicas and mechas.
Two of the most important tech advancements they have shown (at least military-wise) are the Power Armors and Charged Firearms.
RACIAL TRAITS:
Solnoids are as per rulebook humans, with the following additions:
*Solnoids obtain a +2 to any attack rolls involving oozes.
*Solnoids obtain an additional +2 to computer and technical rolls. They also get a +1 to any Pilot/Drive rolls.
*Solnoids have a +1 bonus to any rolls involving rallying other Solnoids.

NEW WEAPONS GADGET:
Charged Firearm
A recent development in weapons technology (engineered from Solnoid technology), Charged firearms contain an additional internal exploding wire or electromagnetic accelerator. This augmented power source fires projectiles with more power, but it's still not as much as, say, a full-blown railgun.
Charged firearms require an additional power source for this system, what it is exactly or where it is located varies from design to design (again, usually it is a slightly enlarged ammo clip withholding a power cell).
A Charged firearm rolls +1 bonus die for damage (e.g., a gun that rolls 2d6 for damage rolls an extra 1d6). However, it also emits a brief high-pitched whine whenever the weapon is first powered up; nearby characters a +4 bonus on their Listen checks to hear a character preparing to attack with a charged firearm. The bullet fired must be specially fitted to the new gun design (the DC modifier includes both the gun and the bullet).
Restrictions: Ballistic handguns and longarms only (not heavy weapons or energy weapons).
Purchase DC Modifier: +2 (Military Only).

New Race-The C'tarl-C'tarl-By Illius_The_Warrior_Pope



C’tarl-C’tarl

A Fiction alien species, pseudo-lycanthropic in nature, the C’tarl-C’tarl are powerful and battle-ready, and it’s pretty damnedly easy to see at first glance why they were regarded with such fear over at their core universe (‘Outlaw Star’). Although most of the C’tarl-C’tarl on Earth are alternate versions of Aisha Clan-clan and other ACCs, their homeworld (named, obviously, C’tarl-C’tarl) is on an Earth-like system several dozen parsecs away from our own. First contact with said homeworld was approximately 100 weeks Post-Vanishing.
The C’tarl-C’tarl Empire (on their core universe) is made up of the species’ home solar system and about a dozen other planets, a few of which are constantly being battled on by other local species.

The C’tarl-C’tarl are a renown warrior race, famous for their fierce pride, enormous egos, combat prowess, lack of good sense, and outrageous stubborness (consider the fact that we barely see them-as a species-on the series beyond Aisha and some questionable members). Their relationship with the denizens of Coreline (and most specially humans) is neutral, to say the least, having fought many battles with the UN, Colonies (planetary and LaGrange), and alien species, only to sign a non-aggression treaty with said power groups. While a great number of C’tarl do have managed to learn to respect the other Coreline races for excellent battles, they still consider themselves superior to all races, even though their overall Technology Level is on par with that of humanity.

C’tarl-C’tarl: Magic, Mysticism, Technology, and Space Travel:

For the most part, C’tarl technology is almost identical to Human tech (weapons tech 5 to 7, space tech about 6 to 7), and they face the same restrictions with space travel as humans do. All C’tarl practice an animistic religion which reveres nature, combat, and the spirits (and their cities and ships reflect this with wide varieties of plants and ‘streams’ all over the place). The C’tarl have no magic practicioners of their own due to the fact that their very nature restricts them form making any use of magic, although they do have a strong resistance to said force (which makes their services as frontline fighters in anti-magic units all the more needed). While they do employ some cybernetics and genetic technology, C’tarl-C’tarl dislike using it on themselves unless it is absolutely necessary, being as they are already quite formidable. For a C’tarl-C’tarl to show weakness-so they say-is almost a crime.
NOTE: Many C’tarl wear what looks like a white collar with a bell attached to it. This is actually a holy symbol of their faith and its not a good idea to make fun of ‘em for it. Also, they dislike being called "animals" or "furries” to the extreme.

Species Appearance:
In their natural state, a Ctarl Ctarl appears much as a human does, with the most notable exceptions being their long, lynx like ears, short fur pelts that range in color from creamy tan to a dark red orange (a few even have stripes and spots), long cat like tail, presence of pointed teeth and claws. Most have stark white to pale yellow hair to jet black hair, which they wear according to rank, age, and clan. Lastly, Ctarl tend to be much more physically fit than most other races, a trait they take great pleasure in lording over the rest of the “inferior” species. The most fascinating trait possessed by the Ctarl is their ability to shape change, though they can only take two forms: a Hominid form (which resembles their natural form only with more pronounced fangs and claws, with a pronounced growth in muscle mass) and the Full Beast form, which appears as a large fusion between a tiger (or some other species of predatory feline) and a human.

Racial Traits:
AUTHOR’S (Illius) NOTE: I think the creator of Outlaw Star based the C’tarl around werewolves, so I have turned to multiple mechanics that handle werewolves to determine their special abilities and racial traits.

Ability Modifiers: +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -2 Intelligence, -4 Charisma. The Ctarl Ctarl are indeed a mighty race blessed with keen senses, but they aren’t the sharpest tools on the shelf and the consept of tact eludes them.
Type: Medium humanoid (shapechanger)
Base Speed: 30 feet
Low-light vision: The Ctarl can see twice as far as humans in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of shadowy illumination.
Natural Armor: The Ctarl have thick hides, granting them a +2 natural armor bonus to defense.
Natural Attack (Bite/Claw): The Ctarl have long since retained the claws and fierce fangs of their ancestors, granting hem two natural attacks (Bite: 1d3 piercing; Claw, 1d4 slashing). These weapons follow the normal rules for multiple weapons.
Skill Bonuses: the Ctarl receive a +4 bonus to Spot, Listen, Search, Balance, Climb, Jump and Tumble checks.
Special Qualities:

Damage Reduction 5/Energy and Magic: The Ctarl Ctarl are a surprisingly durable race, able to withstand brutal punishment and not take a bit of damage. They ignore the first 5 points of damage from any non-energy based weapon. Magic Weaponry might also be able to pierce a Ctarl Ctarl’s thick hide.

Ferocity: Generally speaking, the Ctarl are far to stubborn to stop fighting, no matter how badly injured they are. A Ctarl may continue to act normally when reduced to -1 hit points and are not dead until they reach -15 hit points.

Fast Healing 1: Ctarl regain 1 hit point lost per round, provided they stay above -15 hit points, at which point they simply die.

More Ctarl-Ctarl Goodness
Cool thread marcoasalazarm! I was wondering what you were gonna do with my little d20 Ctarl-Ctarls! Here's some Ctarl Ctarl Talents and my prototype rules to handle their transformation abilities:



Iron Body: Shrug off more damage. Your Damage Reduction improves to 10/magic or energy.

Improved Iron Body: Shrug off damage even from magic weapons. Your Damage Reduction improves to 10/energy.
Required: Iron Body.

Advanced Iron Body: Shrug off even more damage. Your Damage Reduction improves to 15/energy.
Required: Iron Body and Improved Iron Body.

Rage: You can fly into a rage a number of times per day equal to your Constitution modifier. In a rage, you temporarily gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but you take a -2 penalty to Defense. The increase in Constitution increases your hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when your Constitution score drops back to normal (these extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are). While raging, you cannot use any Charisma- , Dexterity- , or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your (newly improved) Constitution modifier. You may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, you lose the rage modifiers and restrictions and become fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter. Entering a rage takes no time itself, but you can do it only during your action, not in response to someone else's action.

Improved Rage: You can fly into a Rage a number of times per day equal to two times your Constitution modifier, and you are not fatigued afterwards.
Required: Rage.

Advanced Rage: You can fly into a Rage any number of times per day, and the ability bonuses it grants are +6 Strength, +6 Constitution.
Required: Rage and Improved Rage.
NOTE: Raging during a Transformation raises the Transforamtion Cost (see Ctarl Ctarl Transformations) by 2

Stubborn Heart: You gain a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves against disease and poison.

Improved Stubborn Heart: Your bonus on Fortitude saves against disease and poison increases to +4, and your fast healing improves to 2 hp/round.
Required: Stubborn Heart.

Advanced Stubborn Heart: You are immune to disease and poison, and your fast healing improves to 4 hp/round.
Required: Stubborn Heart, Improved Stubborn Heart.

Feats:

RAPID MORPH
You can shapeshift quicker than others.
Prerequisite: Con 15+.

OPEN WOUNDS
You cut neatly with you claws.
Prerequisite: Dex 13+, Weapon Finesse, BAB +6
Benefit: If your hit your target with a claw attack bypassing its Defense by five or more points, you manage to open a major blood vessel. The target suffers one additional point of damage per round until it stops the bleeding, either by a Treat Injury check or artificial healing.

Prerequisite: Dex 15+
Benefit: Your base speed is increased by +10 feet.

SURVIVOR
You are almost impossible to put down.
Prerequisites: Con 13+, Improved Damage Threshold.
Benefit: Your massive damage threshold is increased by +3 points.

Ctarl Ctarl Transformations



All Ctarl have a resivoir of Transformation Points equal to their Constitution Score + 1/2 their total Hit Dice. Maintaining their Hominid form costs 3 TP per round while the Full Beast consumes a good 6 (9?) TP per round. Once all of theri Transformation Points are depleated, a Ctarl-Ctarl are exhausted, and lose theri fast healing ability until their TP total rises above 0. TP is recovered 2 points for every hour speant on restful, non-stressful activity.

A Ctarl-Ctarl that has acess to a large amount of food recovers TP at a rate of 2 points per 5 (10?) minutes speant gorging themselves. Transformation into their Hominid form counts as an attack action and the Full Best form requires a full round action.



The rules are in need of a good fine combing, but definatly deviate from the usual x number of transformations per day deal. Hope this helps.

Here's lookin' at you kid:



###As for the Salusian Race...
*-2 Wis (As much as they'd like to, they're not the most well-kept weapons in the armory),
*+2 Cha (" 'cause we're cute").
Some REALLY HEAVY tech base (say, a solid 7?). Their transforming gizmo (that makes them look human) is a sort of full-body 'Instant Cosmetic Surgery' gadget (it's right there on the D20F Gear section, can't renember the name. It changes your face, but knocks you out for a half-hour, I think).

As for the 'super-strength' part, well, Asrial says again and again it's a 'Salusian of Royal Birth' thing, and uses it for 'stunts', so I'd think:
1) is it ONLY for Royal Birthed Salusians?
2) How do I stat it out? Are we taliking a sort of racial ability, like the Ctarl-Ctarl's Rage (check above), a feat only for Royal-Birthed Sals, a racial 'class feature', or just a plain boost in Str score?

I'd appreciate some help with that.

DEADITES




Deadites have but one goal – to test the mettle of man. They see themselves as the inheritors of the Earth and find the presence of mortals to be a disgusting insult to their superiority. Whenever they enter the mortal
world, it is to test man's limits and see if he has what it takes. When man fails the test, they will swarm over the world like flies to honey.

“Deadite” is an acquired template that can be applied to any living, corporeal, non-plant creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creature’s type changes to undead. It uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. There are two types of Deadites: Skeletons and Zombies. Both have their own unique traits, and they both share the following:

Skills, Feats, and Special Qualities: The base creature retains all of its skills, feats, and special qualities, with the exceptions of those that conflict with their undead natures, and deadites lose all Charisma based skills.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1.

Undead: Deadites have the traits and immunities common to the undead.

Hit Dice: Change to d12 and recalculate hit points.

Defense: Based on size: Tiny or smaller +0, Small +1, Medium-size +2, Large +3, Huge +4, Gargantuan +7, Colossal +11.

Allegiances: Change to master (as long as the master still lives), evil, and chaos.

Skeletons:

Ability Modifiers: +4 Dexterity, -2 Strength, -4 Charisma. Having no flesh to weigh them down makes Skeleton Deadites fast as hell, but at the same time it makes them rather weak.

Special Qualities: (Finesse): Skeleton Deadites substitute their Dexterity modifier to melee attack and damage rolls.

Bonus Feats: Skeleton Deadites receive the feats Improved Initiative and Lightning Reflexes.

Natural Weapon (Bite, Claw): Most smart Deadites make use of some form of manufactured weapon, though if unarmed, they can fall back on some sort of natural weapon. In the skeletons case, they may use their bony hands as make shift claws and bite the crap out of people.

Claw/Bite Damage: Diminutive or Fine 1, Tiny 1d2, Small 1d3, Medium-size 1d4, Large 1d6, Huge 1d8, Gargantuan 2d6, Colossal 2d8

Speed: The Deadite Skeleton receives +10 feet to their base speed. If it is capable of flight, its maneuverability drops to Clumsy, though it still benefits from the increase in speed.

Skeleton Immunities (Ex): A Deadite skeleton has cold immunity. Because it lacks flesh and internal organs, a deadite skeleton takes only half damage from ballistic, piercing, or slashing weapons.

Zombies:

Ability Modifiers: +4 Strength, -2 Dexterity, -4 Charisma. Zombie Deadites tend to possesses great strength, but their decaying flesh makes them much less coordinated than their skeleton cousins.

Natural Weapon (Slam): Most smart Deadites make use of some form of manufactured weapon, though if unarmed, they can fall back on some sort of natural weapon. Zombies have only their brute strength to fall back on.

Slam Damage: Fine 1, Diminutive 1d2, Tiny 1d3, Small 1d4, Medium-size 1d6, Large 1d8, Huge 2d6, Gargantuan 2d8, Colossal 4d6.

Special Qualities (Brute Strength): Zombies add 1.5 x their strength modifer in melee damage rolls and are considered to have the Talents "Melee Smash" and "Melee Smash II."

Bonus Feats: Zombies receive the feats "Power Attack" and "Great Fortitude."

Speed: If the base creature can fly, its maneuverability drops down to Clumsy. Otherwise, its base speed is unaffected.

Immunities: Zombies take no damage from cold based attacks; instead they are affected as the spell "Slow."



ZENTRAEDI
Micronized and Large-Sized Zentraedi holding a conversation (taken in the Colombian Jungle, 23 days Post-Vanishing.)


Created in their home universe by the Tirolian Robotech Masters, they are a giant genetically-enginnered warrior race, considered disposable and following the mandates of a history filled with lies. When they first arrived to Earth, they did so searching for a ship lost to them, which had by then been refitted by the local humans to fight back. All of the following fighting revealed several things, such as their genetic similarities with humans, the humans’ unending (and near-maddening) resourcefulness, and the fact that, for all the power available to them, the Zentraedi’s creators should have thought of giving them something like ‘pop culture’.

The Zentraedi that had appeared in Coreline come from many alternate timelines regarding the series (funnily, though, that they have been the newest representatives of the whole ‘Robotech-vs.-Macross’ rivalry that has known to a good deal of Anime fans Pre-Vanishing), in either of two sizes: the standard ‘super-size’ Zentraedi and the ‘micronized’ Zentraedi.
Another large distinction also appears between their appearance during the 23 Hours and a short time Post-Vanishing, when a good number of the Zentraedi have adapted to Earth culture-especially after losing a number of fights to the ‘Minmay Tactic’ or quick-talking.
Units and teams that have obtained Zentraedi say that they can be ‘loyal, reliable, and in time even amiable, but those first times you wanna crack a joke at them is a pain.’

Racial Traits
-Micronized Zentraedi and general traits:
*Medium-Sized Humanoids.
*Speed of 30 ft.
*+2 Strength or Dexterity, +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma: they have been brought up as warriors for countless generations, and so, it’s pretty hard to them to show a soft side.
*Newly-appeared Zentraedi may not select Charismatic Hero or Charismatic Ordinary as their first class: again, warrior upbringing. Their concept of ‘charisma’ mostly comes down to being on the right side of a weapon when making an order.
After a time of exposure (roughly three or four months), Zentraedi have enough of a grasp on the concept of ‘charisma’ to ‘give it a shot’. The GM might then let the Zentraedi cross-class into the Charismatic Hero or Charismatic Ordinary classes, but not before.
*All Zentraedi must select either the Emergency Services, Military, or Technician occupations. And again, their upbringing. For them, it’s just the battlefield and how to survive on it.
*Newly-appeared Zentraedi suffer a -2 penalty to all Bluff, Disguise, Forgery, Gather Information, Knowledge (art, behavioral sciences, business, current events, earth and life sciences, physical sciences, popular culture, streetwise, theology and philosophy), Perform, and Sense Motive checks.
After a time of exposure (roughly three or four months), they might have become acclimated to Earth culture, and these penalties may be reduced to -1 or eliminated altogether at the GM's discretion.
*Zentraedi suffer a permanent -2 penalty to all Craft and Repair checks.

Full-size Zentraedi use the above stats, with the following modifications:
*Size changes to Gargantuan (apply size penalties as appropriate).
*Speed of 50 ft.
*+24 Strength, +12 Constitution (as well as a corresponding increase in hit points).
*-4 Dexterity.
*Damage reduction: 10/--.
*Level Adjustment: +3.

The Second:

U.R.T.V. (U-DO Retro Virus) Units:
Normal U.R.T.V. Units during a firefight (taken during the 23 Hours in Tokyo).


A 'Special' U.R.T.V. Unit (nothing is known, only that it goes by the nick-name 'Jr.').


Produced as biological weapons aganist a xeno-biological menace (Base Universe: Xenosaga), these clones were considered to be completely eliminated (except for 3 or 4) in their home universe, but on a number of Alternate universes, some more survived or were created aside from the original 669.
Of the original 669, 665 were 'normal' and 4 (the last ones) were 'special'.
Again, this number varied on some Alternate universes.
When they arrived to Coreline, they discovered that some things from their universe had come as well (although the thick of it was from 14 years ahead in their timeline), and some not. The lack of the U-DO menace had left them without a purpose to exist, but they soldiered on.

RACIAL TRAITS:
*+2 Int, +2 Will: Speed of mind and mental toughness were requisites of their construction.
*Medium-Sized Humanoids.
*30 Ft. Speed.
*When creating a U.R.T.V. Unit character, roll 1d10.
Result: -1 to 5, the character is a 'normal' U.R.T.V. Unit.
-6 to 10, the character is a 'special' U.R.T.V. Unit (see 'Special Abilities', below).

All U.R.T.V. Units have the following:

*Hive Mind (Ex.): On combat conditions, U.R.T.V. Units can willfully go on a 'Hive Mind' mode for battlefield coordination. This psionic connection has a one-mile radius (all U.R.T.V. Units must stay within a mile of each other for it to work). Any knowledge of a tactic that works aganist an enemy will instantly be known by all others in the link nearby. While in the 'Hive Mind' mode, U.R.T.V. Units are immune to all mind-affecting spells and powers. However, this ability is mentally draining. Whenever the 'Hive Mind' mode is deactivated, all Units that were linked will suffer a -2 penalty to all Will saves, Wisdom and Intelligence-based skill checks for the following 1d4 rounds.

*Telekinesis (Sp): 3/Day, Manifester Level 10, Save DC 10 + U.R.T.V. Unit's Key ability modifier + Power Level.

Special Abilities: A number of U.R.T.V. Units were engineered with additional abilities (on the core universe, this was from Unit 666 to Unit 669, but this could have changed on Alternate Universes). U.R.T.V. Units with these abilities were considred 'monsters' by other U.R.T.V. Units, although on more than one Alternate Universe, they earned the respect of their fellow Units. They are easy to distinguish because of having different eye and/or hair color than their 'brothers'.

The following table shows the more commons abilities added to 'Special' Units, but the GM could authorize additional mutations if he so desires.

Special Abilities (Roll 1d8)
1-2: Immunity to Aging Effects (including natural).
3-4: Regeneration.
5-6: Suggestion (3/Day, Manifester level 10, Save DC 10 + U.R.T.V. Unit's key ability modifier + power level).
7-8: Lesser Body Adjustment (1/Day).
9-10: Fire Bolt.

Level Adjustment: +1 (Normal U.R.T.V. Unit), + 2 (Special U.R.T.V. Unit).


SALUSIANS



This race comes from the universe of ‘Ninja High School’, a race that is to Ben Dunn what the Space Oni is to Rumiko Takahashi. They are loud, obnoxious and like to see Humans (in their core universe and on Coreline) as backwater monkeys.
The Salusians are evolved, anthropomorphic skunks, sizing in average between 5 and six feet tall. The females sport a long, bushy tail and all have a face that is humanoid with a more skunk-like nose and ears, their bodies completely covered with black fur (they all have a diamond-like patch in their foreheads). It is a strange thing to note that they have long since grown out of the skunks’ natural ‘defense mechanism’, replacing it with advanced firepower and technology. They have conquered all of their solar system’s planets and then expanded into a small but powerful conglomerate.
A Salusian sports a normal conformity for their advanced civilization and a sort of aloofness for other civilizations. Like the Space Oni, they are defensive to the point of zealotry for their beliefs (which is one of the many reasons why they are not in even terms with the Oni).

The Salusians sport tactile, olfactory, visual and listening capabilities on par with a normal human's. They are a little more attractive, somewhat more tougher, and for all their high tech, they’re less 'sharp' than a normal human. For an unknown reason, those Salusians that are of royal blood exhibit the ability to enable brief bursts of superhuman strength.
The Salusians speak their own language and can speak other languages as well. Their own language is composedof a lot of vocals.

When on Earth, the Salusians utilize a ‘DNA Transformation Chamber’ to change their appearance to human-like, with the exception of a second skunk-like set of ears located on the top of their head.

The Salusians had settled themselves in Coreline Earth in both the newly-appeared town of Quagmire, Boston, and all over North Carolina.

Racial Traits:
*+2 Con, +2 Cha, -2 Wis.
*+1 bonus to Listen rolls (they have some pretty good hearing).
*When creating a Salusian character, roll 1d10:
Result: -1 to 5, the character is a ‘normal’ Salusian.
-6 to 10, the character has ‘royal’ DNA (the character might not be part of the royal family, though).

Characters with royal DNA have the following additional Ex Ability:
-Super-Strength: 3 times a day, the Salusian character can increase his Strength by 1d8 points. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character’s Con modifier.



The following Race requires the BESM D20 Book or SRD.

THE ‘RED EYES’.

Ayanami Rei Alternate Number TC-1083 during NERV combat drill, photo taken November 5, 2003.

Nick-named this way by the people on the street, the entire race is composed of clones of Kaworu Nagisa and Rei Ayanami, aside from a few ACCs that came from the same program. They came from all sources (escaped from NERV and SEELE facilities, were ‘let go’ because of decommissioning, infiltration missions, or plain error, or were made in some mad scientists’ garage lab), and are roaming around. Some of them are just like the two characters that they look like all the way down to mannerisms and speech patterns, and some of them are looking to distance themselves from their ‘templates’ as much as possible.

"Rei" Red Eyes Racial Stats:
*Base Movement: 0.
*+2 Dex: 1.
*-2 Charisma: -1.
*Special Movement (Cat-Like): 1.

"Kaworu" Red Eyes Racial Stats:
*Base Movement: 0.
*-2 Con: -1.
*+2 Charisma: 1.
*Special Movement (Light-Footed): 1.

Common Racial Traits:
*Sixth Sense (Other ‘Red Eyes’/Evangelion-style ‘Angels’): 2.
*Telepathy: 3.
*Force Field (Abilities: Field-Penetrating): 4.
Total Cost: 10.
Final Cost: 5.



Okay, I found a conversion over at the d20 Anime boards of the Ctarl Ctarl that looks pretty good, and here it is:

Ctarl-Ctarl
Ability Score Modifiers: +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, -2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma
Type: Humanoid (shapechanger)
Medium: As Medium creatures, Ctarl-Ctarl have no special bonuses or penalties due to size.
Speed: Ctarl base speed is 30 ft.
Damage Reduction 5/+1: Ctarl-Ctarl ignore the first 5 points of damage that comes from a non-magic weapon.
Natural Armor Bonus: Ctarl-Ctarl receive a +2 natural armor bonus to defense.
Metamorphosis: Though some yet to be explained biological process, all Ctarl-Ctarl are born with the ability to undergo a transformation that allows them to assume various “beast forms.” Additionally, a Ctarl-Ctarl may become more powerful depending on what phase the planet’s moon is in; consult the following chart for exact details.

Least Beast Shape (Su): Up to four times per day, a Ctarl-Ctarl may cause themselves to transform partially into an animal. In this form, they gain +4 to Str and +2 to Con, and they gain a +1 bonus to natural armor. They also gain two claw attacks that do 1d4 damage. This ability lasts for 3 + (newly improved) Con modifier minutes..

Lesser Beast Shape (Su): A Ctarl-Ctarl can cause themselves to transform more fully into an animal, gaining +6 to Str and +4 to Con, and a +3 bonus to natural armor, as well as two claw attacks that deal 1d6 damage and a secondary bite attack that deals 1d8 damage. Their damage reduction also improves to 10/+1. This ability lasts for 3 + (newly improved) Con modifier rounds. Using this ability consumes two uses of Least Beast Shape; a Ctarl-Ctarl cannot use this ability if they have less then 2 uses of Least Beast Shape left. This ability cannot be used at the same time as Least Beast Shape.

True Beast Shape: Once per day, a Ctarl-Ctarl can transform themselves into an animal. While using this ability, they take the form of an animal (always a quadrepedal predator of some sort, such as a tiger, wolf, lion, ect.). They gain +8 to Str, +2 to Dex, and +4 to Con, a +5 bonus to natural armor, two claw attacks that deal 1d8 damage, a secondary bite attack that deals 2d6, and their base movement speed increases to 50 feet. Their damage reduction improves to 10/sliver. This ability lasts for the duration of the encounter, after which the Ctarl-Ctarl is exhausted until they receive 8 hours of rest. This ability cannot be used if Least or Lesser Beast Shape has been used already, and it consumes all uses of Least Beast Shape (and, by extension, Lesser Beast Shape).

Nice and simple 


Two new races and some Tech.

GENETIC INFANTRYMEN (Gen.I.s).


Developed on an alternate universe for nothing but war, they are tough, efficient… and expendable. Created in their home universe by one of the factions of a civil war in a planet that was hit day in and day out for the better part of two decades with biological and chemical weaponry, their chief advantage over any other kind of ‘super-soldier’ enclave out there in Coreline is their immunity to all kinds of chemical-biological attack.

Nick-named ‘the Blue Men’ (or ‘the Smurfs’ in the street), they have been believed to be all but exterminated in their home universe. However, they have appeared in Coreline by the lots and were immediately drafted into the English SAS (the main unit using them has been nick-named the ‘Blue Men Group’). Their implanted ‘soulchip’ technology has become researched and has become a standard of several other units and agencies.

Racial Traits.
*+2 Str, +2 Con, -2 Wis. Genetic Infantrymen are tough and strong, but were designed to be ‘grunts’ in other aspects.
*+6 bonus to resist biological/chemical weapon effects: The atmosphere of their former planet was nothing but one humongous cloud of toxins. They were designed to all but walk thru them unharmed.
*+2 bonus to resist radiation effects. Strangely, the war over on their homeworld used little nuclear weaponry and on a limited scale, and this part of their design wasn’t as big as the toxic resistance aspects.
*Resistance to Energy (acid) 10: A side-effect of said warfare was a massive production of acid rains.
*Starting cybernetics: Soulchip. All G.I.s have it implanted from development, in order to ‘reduce costs’ in training new soldiers. Just clone, plug and go.

New technology.

Fast-Growth Cloning
One of the many technologies Fictions have access to is the ability to grow clones at an extremely accelerated rate, thru the use of muscle electro-stimulation. Although on several universes cloning has been established as easy and even dirt-cheap, the fast-growing is still in its prototype stages, especially in Coreline.
This allows a body to be completely regrown, without any ability adjustments due to level, enhancements (excluding genetic engineering) or damage being applied, within 2d4 days.
The body will be mindless, however.
Cost: 35.
Restriction: None

Memory Engram Recording
The brain is a highly complex organ. With the furrows and ridges of the brain, as well as stored electrical and chemical charges making up personality, memory and intelligence.
With advanced tissue mapping and imaging, electrostatic mapping, and neuro-chemical tracking, the science of recording the "person" from the brain has been advancing in long steps. Sadly, at the time it is expensive, and care must be taken from keeping the recording from awakening. Those recordings that ‘wake up’ usually hit the virtual "panic button" and request either being put back to sleep, or petition for Artifical Sentience Status.
This keeps all skills, feats, muscle memory, etc at the time of the recording. When combined with the Fast-growth cloning, this allows a PC to be technologically resurrected if they are killed.
Cost: 30.
Restriction: Licensed (+1).

Soulchip
(Extremely) rapid advances in neural mapping courtesy of retro-engineered Fiction technology, the Soulchip is a spinoff technology of the Mental Engram Recording (above) science, and represents a massive leap in recovering those who have died.
In use solely by the military (and some other shadowy organizations) at this time, as the procedure is experimental at best, and the long-term psychological effects are unknown, this chip stores the person's memories of whom it is implanted in.
When the person is killed, the soulchip is designed to do one of two things: one is to broadcast a high-powered, highly compressed signal to an established computer (a.k.a. "Soul Catcher") via an FTL communications wave, where it is recorded.
If for whatever reason the Soulchip cannot perform the communication, they go to ‘backup mode’, where they retain the person’s memories for a passing subject (usually a fellow soldier) to retrieve the chip and carry it to a safe location where they will be downloaded. A tiny built-in A/V sensor system and speaker allow the recorded personality to communicate.
Combined with Force Growth Cloning, a dead character can be back in action within 2d4 days.
Cost: 35.
Restriction: Military (+3)

Soulchip Socket
Sometimes the personality that is inside the Soulchip will desire to help whoever picked it up, and sometimes it will be necessary to link it up to something (to keep it powered, or for it to help).
The Soulchip Socket Gadget can be added to both a weapon or a piece of gear, and allows a Soulchip to be connected to said devices. If added to a piece of gear, the Soulchip’s personality can make rolls in case of the character (using the personality’s skills), or can fire the weapon (using the personality’s BAB and feats, such as Burst Fire and Autofire-if the weapon allows for them to be used). A piece of gear or weapon can only have one Soulchip Socket. The Gadget also adds a basic set of sensors to the piece of gear and the weapon,if they lack it, for the personality to see its surroundings.
DC Modifier: +4.
Restriction: Military (+3).

The following race I built using the 'Infiltrator Cylon' Race of the BSG D20 conversion as a base.

33-S BOOMER


They were built originally as 'sexaroids', but were banned in their core universes' Earth because they had a little 'something extra': they could link with other computers-most specifically, those of advanced weaponry.
On Coreline, thanks to the massive advent of 'construct' and 'Artificial Intelligence' Fictions, the 33-S Boomers have managed to obtain a semblance of belonging, but there's also lots of people who hate them, both from their home universes and from others (for example, the Colonial Remnant slander of "Toaster" is now applied to both them and any Cylons that are on Coreline). As well, since they are still only being produced mainly by Genom (although Stingray Industries has started a limited production run of 33-Ss), they stil feel that they are 'owned' and are searching for their 'freedom' from the megacorp.

Racial Traits:
*Type: Humanoid (Construct).
*Medium-Sized.
*+2Dex, +2 Cha, -2 Wis.
*30 ft. Speed.
*Computer Link (Ex): 33-S Boomers can connect to other computers and access them faster then a normal operator. To connect, the 33-S Boomer must use specialized interface systems or improvise a connection using a wire. In order to do so, the 33-S Boomer must cut thru its skin to access its internal interface ports, doing 1 point of damage to itself.
Once connected, the 33-S Boomer can do a computer-based task taking 1 or more minutes in a full round, while a task requiring 1 or more hours takes 1 minute. The 33-S cannot move during this connection, and so, it loses its Dexterity bonus to Defense, aside from a -2 to any other actions, since it must concentrate for the interface to work.
Disconnecting takes a move action.
*Hypnotic Eyes (Ex): A specialized laser-based luminescence mechanism inside the eyes of the 33-S Boomer allows it a limited hypnotic effect. To do so, the 33-S must do a gaze attack roll, range 30 feet, with the target making a Will saving throw (DC 10 + ½ 33-S’s level + 33-S’s Cha modifier). If the roll is failed, the gazed character will be charmed with one simple command (like ‘go to sleep’ or ‘forget you saw me’).
*Fangs: A 33-S Boomer is equipped with retractable fangs to draw blood. These fangs deal 1d4 (piercing) damage.
*Blood Dependency (Ex): A ‘failsafe’ device created by Genom to prevent ‘rogue’ 33-S Boomers from ‘going too far’ (or rather, to insure their slavery), it is attributed to a programmed ‘seal-off’ of the 33-S’s capabilities to produce its own blood.
A 33-S with this system still activated is slightly anemic. A 33-S with this system activated cannot regain lost hit points naturally, furthermore each day that the damage goes unhealed the 33-S loses one hit point. If a 33-S has a steady supply of blood (artificial or natural-at least must take a pint once per day) it can heal regularly. The 33-S doesn’t obtains any bonuses from drinking blood after the system is deactivated, or a higher amount.
A 33-S must also obtain blood once a month to maintain its metabolic processes (again, it must be at least a pint).

For the Blood Dependency system to be deactivated, specialized software must be downloaded into the 33-S. Stingray Industries-manufactured 33-S Boomers already have such a software downloaded, while Genom-manufactured 33-S’s do not. This software is highly guarded inside Genom and S.I. R&D facilities.
*Skill Bonus: 33-S Boomers have a +1 bonus to Computer Use and Bluff skills.
Level Adjustment: +2.


U.S. Robotics NS-5 Muti-Use Robot.

They were created to help us, or at least that was the main idea. They hail from the universe of the Alex Proyas' film adaptation of 'I, Robot', which was airing both on Chicago and Latin America when the Vanishing hit.

The NS-5 robot series is hard-wired with the Asimov Three Laws of Robotics, but since in the movie they were temporarily corrupted, a good deal of them can choose to ignore them to a degree-and that's what makes them highly dangerous, people say, because they'll do anything to keep humans 'protected'... even killing them in cold blood. The cases involving 'rogue' or 'gone VIKI' (a disrespecful nod to the events of the movie) NS-5s, however, had remained few after the 23 Hours.

Currently, Stingray Industries is producing the NS-5 on a limited basis.

NS-5 - 1st Level Dedicated Ordinary (biodroid - human) (CR - 1/2) (PL 6)

STR: 18 (STR upgrade +6)
DEX: 18 (DEX upgrade +4)
CON: -
INT: 13
WIS: 10
CHA: 5

AC: 21 (+2 Dex, +8 Duralloy Armor, +1 Class Bonus)
HP: 16

Saves: +1 Fort, +4 Ref, +1 Will

Speed: 50 ft. (30ft - human, -10 armor, +30 speed upgrade) / 20 ft. Climb (ferrous surfaces - magnetic feet)

Attacks: +4 melee (manipulator - natural 1d3+4 non-lethal slam damage)
Full Attack: +4/-1 (manipulators - natural 1d3+4 / 1d3+2 non-lethal slam damage)

Skills: (20)
Craft +5 (+1 INT, +4 ranks one Craft Skill or Treat Injury), Knowledge +5 / +3 / +3 (+1 INT, +4 - 1 main knowledge skill, +2 2-secondary knowledge skills), Listen +2 (Wis, +2 Equipment), Profession +4 (Wis, +4 Ranks - Servant), Read/Write Language (English), Sense Motive +4 (Wis +4 Ranks), Speak Language (Native Language), Spot +2 (Wis, +2 Equipment), Treat Injury +4 (Wis, +4 Ranks if no Craft skill taken).

Feats: (none at 1st level)

Talents: (none - ordinary)

Special Abilities:

Immunities: Biodroids are immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, necromancy effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless. They are not subject to nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain (except as noted under Destruction/Restoration, below), energy drain, or the effects of massive damage. They cannot be raised from the dead.

Repairable: Biodroids cannot heal damage on their own but can be repaired using the Repair skill. A successful Repair check (DC 30) heals 1d10 points of damage to a biodroid, and each check represents 1 hour of work.

Equipment: Duralloy Armor (+8 Equipment, -10 feet speed), Speed Upgrade* (+30 ft.), Class IV Sensor System (+2 Listen/Spot), Strength upgrade* (+6), Dexterity Upgrade* (+4), Magnetic Feet* (Climb 20ft on ferrous surfaces), Robolink.

* These functions are held on standby after rolling off the factory, since use of them on a common-day scenario is 1) unnecessary, and 2) a possible risk to the Three Laws. If activated, enhance CR to 2.

COMBAT: An NS-5 will not normally go into combat aganist a human being, since that would be a violation of the Three Laws. If required to fight, an NS-5 will go for non-lethal combat, attempting to restrain or knock out the opponent. A 'gone VIKI' NS-5, however, will always go for highly damaging or lethal methods of combat, regardless of the situation.
In any combat scenario, the NS-5 will use its Speed Upgrade and Dexterity Upgrade to its fullest, doing all sorts of acrobatic stunts to get close to the opponent.


Elves:


Sketch of female Elf during USMC NBC drill, dated 1123 Weeks Post-Vanishing.

The elves are long-lived, somewhat aloof race, that had managed to add an astounding degree of artistry to everything they do, from language to warfare tactics. On Coreline, a great majority of them had been thrown into a harsh scenario and put so down on their luck that it’s hard to believe that they are considered an incredibly beautiful race-but like other Fiction races that live on Coreline, they have adapted.
Elven artistry has appeared everywhere, in a strange example even in Gangsta rap (admittedly, even if it’s the ‘same old’ at heart, it’s odd to listen to a Tupac cover in Elven).
There’s so many variations of this race out there that it would take forever to mention, so we’ll just cover the ‘main template’ Elf and a few of the variations in here.

Racial Traits:
--‘Main’ Elf: So called because they’re the ones with the most closeness to a ‘main template’ of Elves by mainstream Pre-Vanishing Fiction. They are the most ‘middle-of-the-way’ of the bunch, and as such, the more adaptable. They have spreaded all over Coreline, especially on cities like Chicago, Mexico, San Jose, Tokyo and London.
*Ability Score Modifiers: +2 Dexterity, –2 Constitution.
*Medium: As Medium creatures, elves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
*Speed: Elf base land speed is 30 feet.
*Immunities: Immunity to magic sleep effects, and a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or effects.
*Low-Light Vision: An elf can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
*Racial Skills: +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.

--‘Magical’ Elves: They are a variation of the ‘Main’ Elf, in that their society has gone on and developed magic as high as technology-to the point that they just cannot interact with the latter as well as the ‘Main’, so they have gone on and stayed away from the cities.
They are located in areas like Scotland, the English countryside, New Zealand and the Alps.
Racially speaking, they are the same as the ‘Main’ elves, with the following exceptions:
*Arcane Skills: Elves automatically gain the Arcane Skills feat as described in Urban Arcana. (The character gains the following class skills, as described under the Mage advanced class: Concentration, Craft (chemical), and Spellcraft. Further, the character gains Use Magic Device as a class skill, as described under the Occultist advanced class.)
*Magecraft: Elves are naturally gifted in magics and arcana obscura. Elvish spellcaster have a +1 bonus on Difficulty Class to resist for all spells they cast. In addition all Elves can manifest 1 Level 0 spell per day from any spellcaster list. This is in addition to any other spells the character may be able to cast.
*Technophobic: The ‘Magical’ elves are technophobic creatures. They take a -4 species penalty on skill checks that require an understanding of technological items, including Computer Use, Craft (Electronic), Demolitions, Disable Device, Drive, Pilot and Repair checks.

+Aquatic Elves: This Elven sub-species had adapted to a semi-amphibious lifestyle, being capable to breathe underwater and swim pretty fast. Because of this, they have expanded on several coastal areas (such as Washington, Maine, California, Jamaica, Okinawa and Venice, Italy) and off-coast colonies (most of them abandoned Pre-Vanishing rigs).
Racial stat-wise, they have all of the same abilites as ‘Main’ Elves, except as follows:
* +2 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence: Aquatic elves are as flexible as their land bound cousins, but their life underwater is one- dimensional fundementally, giving them a penalty to intelligence.
* Swim 40 feet.
* Gills: Aquatic elves can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of Constitution before they start to drown.
* Low-Light Vision: As ‘Main’ Elves, except its four times the range of humans.

+Drow Elves: If there is one variety of Elves out there that is more divided and misunderstood than the Drow, it still has to show face. Countless amounts of Pre-Vanishing fiction shows them as en extreme evil, and so they are prejudiced. But the division inside them is large. Several of them want nothing to do with any pantheons, and have adapted to living on the streets.
Inside the Pantheons, the division is great: there’s the original ones to Lolth and Eilistraee, and there’s a third, rapidly growing one: to an Alternate of Naruto Uzumaki that got ascended (originally) as a prank, and to the prankster’s bad luck, got no turning back. This pantheon actually enforce the Drow to be friends, and eschews conventional magic in favor of Jutsus.
They have all of the same abilites as the Elves, except as follows:
*+2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma - Drow elves are almost selectively bred to favor a keen intellect and strong personality.
Medium: As Medium creatures, drow have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
Speed: Drow base land speed is 30 feet.
Immunities: Immunity to sleep spells and similar magical effects, and a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.
Darkvision: Drow can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and drow can function just fine with no light at all.
Light Sensitivity: Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds a drow for 1 round. In addition, drow take a –1 circumstance penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks while operating in bright light unless equipped especially (with dark glasses, for example).
Racial Skills: +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. A drow who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.
Spell Resistance (Ex): A drow gains Spell Resistance equal to 5 + half her character level (rounding down).
Elven Subtype: For all effects related to race, a drow is considered an elf.

+Gray Elves: This particular sub-species of the ‘Magic’ Elf is smarter, haughtier, more experienced magic-wise and bookish.
Their natural preference to avoid physical confrontation and be left alone to expand on their research has made them go to aislated areas like the Tibet and the Argentinean Ands.
Racial Stats: They have the same abilities as the ‘Magic’ Elf, except for the following>
*+2 Intelligence, -2 Dexterity, -2 Strength, -2 Constitution: Gray elven society favors knowledge and wand mobility over physical strength.
*Their constant research has given them an additional +1 racial bonus to Arcane Skill rolls.

+Wild Elves: They are a semi-barbaric variety of Elves, who believe as a whole that everybody Elf (even the ‘magical’ ones) has lost its connection to the woods. Not to say that they despise technology, but that they have taken it and magic as crutches to adapt to the Coreline. They live a nomadic lifestyle, and the few settlements they do have are located in out-of-the-way middle-of-nowhere towns in the Southwest, Brasil and Australia..
They have all of the same abilites as the common elves, except as follows:
* +2 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence: Wild elves have the agility of the other sub-races, but their life in the wild doesn't lead to many geniuses.
*+1 to Handle Animal (horse), Ride and Survival Skill rolls

+Wood (‘Psi’) Elves: They are the ‘other’ wild elves, the ones that follow your every move in the forests, but you might never see. They are akin with the ‘Magic’ Elves in that they have reached an innate connection with one of the ‘ethereal’ forces, but in their case, it’s psionics. The fact that psionics are rarer among Elves than magic, and their own desire to be left alone, has made them be extremely reclusive. They live in the forests of the East and West coasts, Colorado, Canada and the Latin Americas.
They have all of the same abilities as the common elves, except as follows.
*+2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma - Wood elves are strong and swift, but their reclusive lifestyle seldom leads to higher learning and social skills.
*Wood elves gain the ‘Track’ Feat for free.
*Psionic Skills: Elves automatically gain the Psionic Skills feat as described in Urban Arcana. (The character gains the following class skills, as described under the Telepath advanced class: Autohypnosis, Concentration, and Psicraft.)
*Psionic Abilitiesi: Wood Elves are naturally gifted in psionics. Elvish psionicists have a +1 bonus on Difficulty Class to resist for all psionics they cast. In addition all Elves can manifest 1 Level 0 spell per day from any Psionics list. This is in addition to any other psionics the character may be able to cast.
*Technophobic: The Wood elves are technophobic creatures. They take a -4 species penalty on skill checks that require an understanding of technological items, including Computer Use, Craft (Electronic), Demolitions, Disable Device, Drive, Pilot and Repair checks.


DWARVES



They were considered in Pre-Vanishing Fiction with the following things: 1) a high degree of technical knowledge, 2) a near-primal distaste for the Elves, 3) a more ‘rough-party-guy’ kind of aloofness. On Coreline, they adapted because they immediately went into reverse-engineering the advanced technology from other Fiction races, and the one from Pre-Vanishing. They have made a reputation by creating technology that is ‘AK-47 reliable’, that is extremely simplistic, but that does the job just as well, and is guaranteed to do the job no matter how much punishment you drive it thru.
On Coreline, there are 3 variations of the Dwarves: the ‘spacer’ Dwarves, the ‘modern’ or ‘techie’ Dwarves and the ‘magic’ Dwarves. Unlike the ‘foolish Elves’, the magic-using Dwarves are not as technophobic.

+‘Spacer’ Dwarf: So called because they first appeared along with the off-world colonies, they have developed their bodies and society slightly different from the other Dwarven societies, in that they make emphasis in ‘find a job, get a crew, keep ‘er flying’.
They have spreaded themselves all other the off-world colonies and the Asteroid Belt.
Racial Traits: They are statistically the same as ‘Modern’ Dwarves except for the following:
*Bonus Feats: Spacer Dwarves obtain the ‘Spacer’ and ‘Zero-G Training’ Feats for free.
*Land Cherries: Spacer Dwarves have been up in space from birth to (hopefully) death. They live among the stars and planetoids with low gravity. As such, their bodies (even if sturdy) are not adapted to go around Earth-like gravity, which can cause temporal dizziness and lack of coordination and stamina, at least at first.
Whenever a Spacer Dwarf gets onto a planet or space station with ‘normal’ (1.0g) gravity or higher, they get a -2 penalty to any Dexterity and Constitution-based rolls. This penalty disappears after the Spacer Dwarf has been 120 continuous hours on the planet. If the Spacer Dwarf leaves the planet and then returns, the penalty will reappear until another 120 hours have passed.

+’Modern’ (‘Techie’) Dwarves: So called because they have adapted themselves towards the eccentricities of modern technology and lifestyles, they are the most common Dwarf: the hardy tinkerer, the hardy-around-the-edges gadgeteer. Unfortunately, they sacrificed some of their grip on their magical roots in order to obtain their grip on technology (and isn’t THAT such a common thing among ‘advanced civilizations’?). They are pretty much everywhere where technology is widely used, such as Japan and Silicon Valley.
Racial Traits:
*Ability Score Modifiers: +2 Constitution, –2 Charisma.
Medium: As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
*Speed: Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such situations).
*Darkvision: Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves can function just fine with no light at all.
*Heat Resistance: Dwarves are used to extremely hot temperatures. They have a natural Heat Resistance of 5.
*Stability: A dwarf gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).
*Racial Skills: +2 racial bonus on Craft checks.
*Racial Saving Throw Bonus: +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison. +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.
*Racial Attack Bonus: +1 racial bonus on attack and damage rolls against Ogres.

+’Magic’ Dwarves: So called because they, of all three variations, are the ones that mostly uses magic. They view magic as they view technology: as items that must be meshed together and developed to their utmost degree. As such, they have become one of first races to develop technomagic, and they are –still- the best teachers in the subject in magic courses all around Coreline.
Racial Traits:
They are statistically the same as ‘modern’ Dwarves, except for the following:
*Arcane Skills: Dwarves automatically gain the Arcane Skills feat as described in Urban Arcana. (The character gains the following class skills, as described under the Mage advanced class: Concentration, Craft (chemical), and Spellcraft. Further, the character gains Use Magic Device as a class skill, as described under the Occultist advanced class.)
*Magecraft: Dwarves are naturally gifted in magics and arcana obscura. Dwarven spellcasters have a +1 bonus on Difficulty Class to resist for all spells they cast. In addition all Dwarves can manifest 1 Level 0 spell per day from any spellcaster list. This is in addition to any other spells the character may be able to cast.


GNOMES



They were also seen in Pre-Vanishing Fiction as a ‘tinkerer’ race, but in contrast to the Dwarves’ ‘AK-47 reliability’, the Gnomes were sophisticated, advanced, and not a little bit unwilling to use said technology as means for some prank. They like a good life-and they’d like nothing less than a smooth trip to get it.
On Coreline, there’s two versions of the gnomes: the ‘techie’ Gnomes and the ‘magic’ Gnomes. They both represent extremes of the Gnomes’ natural tinkering, because while the ‘techie’ Gnomes have embraced technology to the point of adapting cybernetics to themselves to overcome some biological shortcomings (and in the way, obtain a lot of moolah thru research grants and merchandising), the ‘magic’ Gnomes have developed magic (especially illusionary magic) to a high degree (for which several special effects firm (like ILM) employ them).

+’Techie’ Gnomes: they were called this way because they obtained a high degree of technology knowledge, to the point of making cybergrafts almost second nature among themselves. They are located all over Coreline, but have found a niche on the off-world Colonies.
Racial Traits:
Size: Small.
Ability Modifiers: –2 Strength, +2 Constitution.
Base Speed: 20 feet.
Special Combat Bonuses: Gnomes gain a +1 species bonus on attack rolls against bugbears, goblins (and other goblinoids), and kobolds. Gnomes also gain a +4 dodge bonus to their Defense against giant creatures (such as ogres and trolls); this bonus represents special training that gnomes undergo, during which they learn tricks that previous generations developed in their battles with giants. Note that any time a gnome loses his positive Dexterity bonus to Defense, such as when he’s caught flat-footed, he loses this dodge bonus, too.
Bonus Feat: ‘Techie’ Gnomes receive the ‘Cybertaker’ Feat for free.
Low-Light Vision: Gnomes can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
Skill Bonuses: Gnomes gain a +2 species bonus on Listen checks. Gnomes who have one or more ranks in the Craft (mechanical) and Craft (electrical) skills also gain a +2 species bonus on Craft (mechanical) and Craft (electrical) checks.

+’Magic’ Gnomes: So called because they have gone the ‘other’ way of the spectrum and forged a heavy amount of advanced magic, although they specialize in illusionary magic. They are located all over the British Isles, especially because they don’t like to wander too far off from their homelands (or where they first appeared during the Hours).
Size: Small.
Ability Modifiers: –2 Strength, +2 Constitution.
Base Speed: 20 feet.
Special Combat Bonuses: Gnomes gain a +1 species bonus on attack rolls against bugbears, goblins (and other goblinoids), and kobolds. Gnomes also gain a +4 dodge bonus to their Defense against giant creatures (such as ogres and trolls); this bonus represents special training that gnomes undergo, during which they learn tricks that previous generations developed in their battles with giants. Note that any time a gnome loses his positive Dexterity bonus to Defense, such as when he’s caught flat-footed, he loses this dodge bonus, too.
Illusion Mastery: Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against Illusion spells cast by gnomes.
Speak with Animals: Once per day, a gnome can use speak with animals to speak with a burrowing mammal (a mole, gopher, ground hog, and so forth). It has a duration of 1 minute, and the gnome is considered a 1st-level caster when he uses this spell-like ability, regardless of his actual level.
Low-Light Vision: Gnomes can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
Saving Throw Bonus: Gnomes gain a +2 species bonus on saving throws against illusions.
Skill Bonuses: Gnomes gain a +2 species bonus on Listen checks. Gnomes who have one or more ranks in the Craft (pharmaceutical) and Knowledge (Earth and Life Sciences) skills also gain a +2 species bonus on their checks.
Bonus Feats: Gnomes gain the bonus feat Archaic Weapons Proficiency.
Gnomes with Charisma scores of 10 or higher gain the bonus feat Magical Heritage.

HALFLINGS:




This particular race is only encountered on one country: New Zealand. This is because they don’t have a large desire (but some would rather call that ‘fear’) to leave their rather comfy lifestyles, and villages, for the search of adventure. Their villages do, however, produce some impressive quantities of food products, enough for the Halfling communities to have a solid grip on the small territory they cover. However, some of the ‘tallest’ races have shown some desire to take the Halflings’ lands (although most of them are just dark jokes), and so, the Halflings’ communities have started to train a small self-defense army for themselves.

Size: Small. Halflings gain a +1 size bonus to Defense, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. They suffer a –4 size penalty on grapple checks. Halflings must use smaller weapons than humans use, and their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.
Ability Modifiers: –2 Strength, +2 Dexterity.
Base Speed: 20 feet.
Special Combat Bonuses: Halflings gain a +1 species bonus on attacks with thrown weapons and slings.
Saving Throw Bonuses: Halflings gain a +1 species bonus on all saving throws. In addition, they gain an additional +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear.
Skill Bonuses: Halflings gain a +2 species bonus on Climb, Jump, Listen, and Move Silently checks.
Bonus Feat: Halflings gain the bonus feat Archaic Weapons Proficiency.

GOBLINS:



On Coreline, they have decided to use their large numbers and become the one thing they can truly be: troops. On every conflict Post-Vanishing, such as the Central-American Wars and the Zero-One raid, there were Goblins there. They have built a reputation as mercenaries, and what determines the loyalty of a Goblin on Coreline might be the size of your wallet as much as your motivation.
Even then, some of them are not *that* stupid. They are still guns-for-hire, yeah, but not dumb enough to throw their lives away for no reason (or just charge head-long into a fight). It is this (relative) minority that is more sought after by contracting companies and the common street-variety ‘needy person’.
Racial Traits:
Size: Small.
Ability Modifiers: –2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, –2 Charisma.
Base Speed: 30 feet.
Darkvision: Goblins can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and goblins can function with no light at all.
Skill Bonus: Goblins gain a +4 species bonus on Move Silently checks.
Bonus Feat: Goblins are keenly aware of their surroundings and gain the bonus feat Alertness.

THE ‘HANS’


On Coreline and Fictions universes, sometimes, Humans and other species marry. Sometimes, crimes occur. And sometimes, experiments are performed. Whatever happens, the legacy, however enduring, is easy to see: hybrids between Humans and said species. With special abilities and adaptability gained from both species, they consider their mixed legacy to be both a blessing and a curse.
On Coreline, the ‘Hans’ (so called because of the Japanese term for ‘Half’ or ‘Hybrid’) are all on the same wagon, especially because sometimes one or other bloodline is misunderstood, and they have to choose which species to try to stand up to. As such, they consider whatever friends they have to be a valuable commodity.
There’s as many hybrids out there as there are races in Coreline, so this block is made to show a small number of them.

Half-Elves: This text describes the “main” half-elf, and although the other elven races have had their share of half-breeds (the half-drow being one of them), its nonetheless the main elf the one who has the majority of recorded cases.
+ “Main” Half-Elf:
Racial Traits:
*Medium-Size: As Medium-sized creatures, half-elves have no special bonuses or penalties due to size.
*Half-elves speed is of 30 feet.
*Low-Light Vision: Half-elves can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
*+1 racial bonus on Listen, Search and Spot checks: Half-elves DO NOT have the elf’s ability to notice secret doors by simply passing near them. Half-elves have keen senses, but not as keen as those of an elf.
*Elven Blood: For all special effects and abilities, a half-elf is considered an elf. A half-elf can, for example, use magic weapons and items with racially-specific elven powers as if they were elves.
*Immunity to sleep spells and similar magical effects, and a +1 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or effects.

+Half-Drow: Seen by the most backwards of elves (and, sometimes, other half-elves) as the result of an unholy matrimony, the half-drow are the other recorded majority for other half-elf births. Although some of them have come from evil drow, the majority of half-drow are from “good” ones, and-thanks to this-it is not a rare occurrence to find small chapels to Elistratree inside hospitals, next to the maternity wards, and for half-drow to be treated as equals (at least by other half-elves).
Racial Traits are like half-High Elves, except for the following:
*Medium-Size: As Medium-sizes creatures, half-drow have no special bonuses or penalties due to size.
*Half-drow speed is of 30 feet.
*Darkvision: Half-drow can see in the dark up to 40 feet. Darkvision is black-and-white only, but it is otherwise like normal vision, and half-drow can function just fine with no light at all.
*+2 racial bonus to Will saves against spells and spell-like abilities.
*Light Blindness (Ex) - Abrupt exposure to bright light like the spell daylight or sunlight blinds a half-drow for 1 round. While operating in bright light, they recieve a -1 circumstance penalty to all attacks, saves, and checks unless using protective devices, such as dark glasses.

Half-Orcs: They usually come from far-off areas in Fiction universes and Coreline, where law is a little more lax. And let’s not say that they’re barbarians, but it’s easy to see that they have obtained the impulsiveness for action of their orcish relatives.
Racial Traits:
*+2 Strength, -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma.
*Medium-Sized.
*Half-Orc base speed is 30 feet.
*Darkvision: Half-orcs can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black-and-white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and half-orcs can function just fine with no light at all.
*Orc Blood: For all special effects and abilities, a half-orc is considered an orc. For example, a half-orc can use special orc weapons or magic items with racial-specific orc powers as if they were orcs.
*Bonus Feat: Half-orcs gain the bonus feat Archaic Weapons Proficiency.

Inu-Youkai Hanyous: This particular kind of hybrids, insofar, only exist in Japan. They represent the race that is Rumiko Takahashi’s character, Inu Yasha, and a number of ACCs. They are loud and rather rude, but they are pretty nasty short-range fighters. It is, however, the fact that their demonic blood is just waiting for the right moment to come out and tear everything apart, that keeps a large number of them incommunicado from the world at large. Which –for some- suits them just fine.
Inu-Youkai Hanyous have the following racial traits:
*+4 Str. Their Youkai heritage makes hanyou exceptionally strong.
*+2 Dex. Their youkai heritage also makes Hanyou very agile.
*-2 Wis. The youkai blood clouds the minds of Hanyou.
*-4 Cha. Because of their youkai heritage, most people hate and often try and kill Hanyou. This prejudice, combined with the isolation it imposes upon them, make them very bad at social interaction.
*All Hanyou have extremly sharp senses, and have Scent and receive a +2 Racial bonus on Spot, Search, and Listen checks.
*Hanyou recover much faster than normal people. Hanyou regain 1 hp/level+con modifier every hour.
*Claws: All Hanyou deal base 1d6 when fighting unarmed. For Martial Artists and any other class with higher than normal Unarmed damage, the hanyou will always deal one category higher than his level indicates.
*Human Form: Once per month, at a phase of the moon chosen by the player at creation, the hanyou becomes fully human. He loses the +4 Str, +2 Dex bonuses, and loses his sharp senses [Bonus of Spot, Listen, Search, and Scent feat]. He loses his claw damage. He also gains a +4 Cha bonus as long as he is in human form, because his youkai heritage is not apparent. He also gains a +2 Wisdom bonus because his demonic blood is no longer clouding his mind. This lasts from nightfall till sunrise.
*Youkai Form: When a Hanyou with 10 HD or more has his life seriously threatened [GM's call], his Youkai blood takes full control. He gains a massive +10 to Str, Dex and Con. He instantly regains full HP, including the addtional HP from his Con modifier. His Int, Wis, and Cha are reduced by (2*number of times transformed)[Special note: This doesn't affect his Will save, but otherwise full effects apply]. His unarmed attack now deals 1d10. The first time this transformation happens, the hanyou will mostly rememeber himself, and can control his actions. But as his Int, Wis and Cha drop with each successive transformation, he becomes more of a mindless killing machine. A strong shock or knocking the Hanyou unconscious can bring him back into normal state.
*Level Adjustment: +2.

(The following write-ups were made w/a lot of trial-and-error-sorry, just started to watch. Appreciate any help w/this).
GALLIFREY:

Planet Gallifrey, the home of the Time Lords, is (or depending on who exactly you ask, WAS) a staple of the TV series ‘Doctor Who’. The planet’s inhabitants were, back in their home dimension, the masters of time and space, capable of traveling the whole of it the same way a common human would go the closest store. They had lots of knowledge-and the law to not interfere with other races’ histories. It was wiped out recently, by an event called, quite appropriately, the ‘Time War’.
But CLULESS had other ideas. As well as well-known characters of the series (friend and for alike) appeared on Coreline, the planet proper appeared on the very edge of the Sol System, past Pluto, inside a time-space bubble that had made it all but undetectable to scans from Earth. While this distortion has made them impossible to detect by conventional means, they found out during the 23 Hours (thru contact with those Time Lords and Alternated that were on Coreline) that their own worst nightmare has come to pass: there were lots –LOTS- of individuals with access to time-travel technology, and the cold-bloodedness to travel back and change history to their own whims. Fortunately (or UNfortunately, it seems) there is no way to go back to any time before the 23 Hours that holds CLULESS proper-all attempts have only managed to reach alternate universes located in Earth’s past.
Even so, the Gallifreyians decided –with a lot of aplomb by ‘renegade’ members- to throw their laws of non-interference out the window. With such a potential for damage out there, remaining so would do nothing but harm to themselves.
And so, there’s representatives of the planet on the UNSC and select agencies on Coreline, not all of them Time Lords, but all of them having at least some knowledge of temporal mechanics.

Gallifreyans: Born in Gallifrey (although the term is more of a misnomer since they are ‘woven’ by a genetic Loom), they have generations of genetic engineering on their blood. Lots of them have first appeared in Coreline during the 23 Hours as an effect of CLULESS wondering what the hell happened. Not all of them are very disposed to be adventurers, since their upbringing was much academic, but even then, they make great advisors.
Racial Traits:
*Medium Humanoids (Gallifreyians).
*Ability Modifiers: +2 Wis, +2 Int.
*Base Speed: 30 Feet.
*Racial Skills: All Gallifreyans consider Knowledge (Temporal Sciences) to be a class skill.
*Gallifreyans come with a standard package of genetic enhancements which include:

Fast Healing (Ex) 1: A Gallifreyan heals 1 point of damage each round so long as he has at least 1 hit point.

Low–Light Vision (Ex): A Gallifreyan has low-light vision and can see objects twice as far away as a basic human. The effective radius of bright light or shadowy illumination is doubled.

Respiratory Bypass (Ex): A Gallifreyan can close down his respiratory system for a number of rounds equal to his Constitution x 3. This can be used to hold the effects of smoke and gas at bay.

Scent (Ex): This ability allows the Gallifreyan to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes and track by sense of smell.

Weakness to Gas Attacks: If a Gallifreyan fails to activate his Respiratory Bypass their enhanced sense of smell causes them to take a –4 penalty on Fortitude Saves to resist gas attacks. Corrosive gases inflict double damage.

In addition, Gallifreyans that become Time Lords receive:

Lindal Gland (Ex): A biological implant which triggers the process of regeneration when a Gallifreyan’s hit points fall below 0. This process can be activated a maximum of 12 times.

Telepathy (Su): Any Gallifreyan with an Intelligence of 6 or higher can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

*Free Language: Gallifreyan, an odd combination between mathematical symbols and (apparent) Greek symbols, used in extremely long sequences per word.
*Level Adjustment: +3.

REGENERATION RULES: Regeneration is automatically triggered when a Time Lord’s hit points fall to -10 or lower, or when a Massive Damage Save is failed, or in any circumstance in which the Time Lord’s body dies. The body must exist for Regeneration to take place- if the body is disintegrated, for example, Regeneration is not possible.

The process of Regeneration recreates the character’s physical body and usually generates a new personality. When a character undergoes Regeneration, generate a new set of scores for Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. You may choose to determine a new personality for the character. The character looses all permanent Doubt points in the process of Regeneration. The character’s level, hit points, skills, feats and all other characteristics remain the same.

The character wakes from Regeneration after 1D6 hours with their full hit point total, but Shaken. The Shaken condition lasts for 1D6 hours. Additionally, dying tends to be quite traumatic and the character must make a Will saving throw (DC 15 + number of previous Regenerations) or suffer the effects of a Disorder, determined randomly from the following table.

Regeneration Disorders
Disorder Result on D20
Amnesia 1-8
Depression 9-12
Obsession 13-16
Paranoia 17-20

Duration of Regeneration Disorder
Will Save failed by Duration
1-5 1d10 minutes
6-9 1d10 hours
10+ 1d10 days

(GM’S NOTE): On Issues of Balance: The ability to Renew Time Lords obviously apart from other characters. Regeneration is a significant asset for a character, but in practice it does not raise issues of balance. Regeneration effectively marks the end of one character and the beginning of another. The post-Regeneration Time Lord could even be played by a different person. In this way, the game effect of Regeneration is ultimately the same as a character dying and then being replaced by an entirely new character.

NEW SKILL: Knowledge (Temporal Sciences) (INT) Trained Only
This category of Knowledge encompasses all the complex theories and knowledge related to manipulating, using, and traveling through time and space.


The following two races are (to my own belief) powerful, but maybe my changes balanced them a little. I am a little biased aganist adding this series to the setting, but my friends are big-deal fans of this, and did everything short of pointing a gun to my head to make me post them.

These racial write-ups were made by Malanchon over at the GoO boards. (Arigato, dude).
They require the BESM D20 Rulebook.


There's a reason they are feared, you know...

Saiyan

Hailing from a long dead world, the race of warriors known as Saiyans were feared wherever they appeared in their home universe. Originally vile mercenaries, Saiyans now wander the cosmos aimlessly, with no roots to ground them. They are a dying race, and so it is rare to come across more than two or three together. Saiyans live to fight, and nothing makes them happier than to face a great challenge.
Their first appearances in Coreline were the next thing to having thrown nukes. They destroyed multiple towns, blasted holes in the countryside, murdered lots of people as they went on a fighting binge aganist other races and each other. And when people returned from the Vanishing, it stil took a lot to get them under control.

It is not hard to suppose that they are feared A LOT by lesser races, no matter where they stand in a particular conflict.

Personalities: Saiyans are loud and aggressive. They often charge blindingly into combat just for the thrill of it. Although not all are bloodthirsty, and there is a surprising number of gentle Saiyans, combat is their life and blood.

Physical Descriptions: Saiyans appear as diverse as humans, with many giants in their midst. However, even the smallest among them is strong and compact. Saiyans only grow hair on their heads, which is always black and spiky, and by the time they reach maturity, they no longer grow or regrow any hair. Most Saiyans are also distinguished by a long brown tail usually wrapped around their waist.
It is well-known by those Otaku who survived the 23 Hours that a Saiyan with a tail looking at the full moon would grow into the Oozaru (Weremonkey) Form, and be incredibly hard to stop. However, for some reason, the moon of Coreline (and other moons in this universe) lack whatever factor is required for the Form to appear.

Relations: Saiyans are most often of chaotic alignment. They are self-focused and flippant of others. Many older Saiyans are also evil, who only want to spread more carnage and relish in their physical superiority.
Although there are as many good Saiyans as there are evil Saiyans in Coreline, the fights that Saiyans are known to wage (which can only be described as 'WMD hitting'), unfortunately, has given them a perennial bad rep.

Adventurers: Saiyans wander because they have nothing better to do. No longer organized as mercenaries, Saiyans go out to find worthy battles and to develop their inner powers. Some strive to achieve the legendary “Super Saiyan” status (which, thank God, not all of them can achieve. Those who DO, however...).

Saiyan Traits- Point Cost
Base Movement: 0
+2 Strength: 1
+2 Constitution: 1
-2 Wisdom: -1
-2 Charisma: -1
Alternate Form (Oozaru): 2
Painful Training: 2
Stubborn Body: 1
+2 to Intimidate Skill Checks: 0.5
+2 to Survival Skill Checks: 0.5
Total Cost: 6
Adjusted Cost: 0

Alternate Form (Oozaru/Weremonkey)- Full Powered Version with the Defects: Blind Fury (3 BP), Involuntary Physical Change (1BP), Restriction (2 BP), and Vulnerability (1 BP). The Attribute gained is Size Change (Growth) +2.
The Vulnerability is the Saiyan’s tail, if it is grabbed, then all the Saiyan’s attributes drop by 2, and the Saiyan feels weak and drowsy. The Tail is a reservoir of Chi for the Saiyan, and under the light of the full moon (Restriction), a Saiyan who still has his tail is forced to transform into the Oozaru Form, in order to empty the body of excess Chi before the Saiyan is burnt up by his own energies (Involuntary Physical Change). The Oozaru is a giant Ape-like form, which suffers from a bestial madness (Blind Fury).
Should the Saiyan lose his tail, he loses the Alternate Form Attribute and all it’s defects. He gains 2 bonus CP instead.

However, the full moon in Coreline doesn’t has whatever is required for the Saiyans to achieve this transformation (it has been theorized that maybe the full moon’s rays in the DBZ universes have an additional frecuency that instill the transformation and that this version of the Moon lacks, but since other kinds of Werecreatures change with ease, this has not been proven).

Painful Training- Saiyans grow stronger from near death experiences. Whenever they are brought to negative HP, then recovers without dying, Saiyans gain a special experience bonus. This is calculated by how many hit points below zero the Saiyan reached, multiplied by their character level, and multiplied again by 100. For stronger campaigns, a DM may choose to let the Saiyan character gain bonus CP equal to half the negative HP the Saiyan survives. DMs may limit how much experience or CP a Saiyan would receive for self-inflicted wounds. This traits does not prevent a Saiyan from dying like any other character.

Stubborn Body- Saiyan bodies are conditioned to ignore many of the rigors of aging. They only receive a –1 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution at Old age, and do not suffer any penalties at Middle or Venerable age.

Namek

Well, they look freaky...

The quiet and ascetic race known as Nameks are practically legendary, known for their great magic and miracles, until the race nearly died out a millennia ago. No one knows why the race faced extinction, and the Nameks themselves do not talk about it. Now, most Nameks are solitary folk, content to spend their lives tending their planet, although occasionally a Namek learns how to fight, but only to protect. In the deeper outskirts of space roam other Nameks unaffected by the cataclysm, and some of these are arrogant and villainous.
They appeared on Coreline at the same time as the Saiyans, and although the grand majority of them decided to live and let live (moving deep into Asia and Australia), several of them wagered fights as destructive as the Saiyans'. Maybe the fact that most people recognized that Nameks would rather leave them be stopped them from getting the same bad rep as Saiyans.

Personalities: Most Nameks are cold and controlled, preferring to let their actions speak for themselves. They also tend to watch and judge others.

Physical Descriptions: Quite a distinguishing race, Nameks are green-skinned humanoids with no body hair, two antennae on their foreheads, and tan sections over their body. They often choose loose and simple garment.

Relations: Nameks tend to be cold and short-spoken to others, alienating most other by their attitude. However, if one should earn the Namek’s respect, then they have gained a friend for life.

Alignment: The Namek’s steely control is the epitome of being Lawful, and most prefer a neutral outlook to the consequences of good and evil.

Adventurers: Very few Nameks choose to adventure, although there is an occasional wonderment about the rest of the universe, and that is where most Namek adventurers come from. Rarely does a Namek become concerned about wealth, but personal development is very important to them.

I wanted to add the series here, but didn't knew exactly how (logically, Firefly-class transports have a high use among the Colonies, but that's about as far as I came).

I'd give it my best with a few ideas.

In any case... for now, enjoy the following monster stats:

The Daleks.




From out of the smoke, you notice a machine, that looks like a human-sized pepperpot, rolling towards you. The upper side has a single stalk ending in a lens, and two more stalks lower down, one with a suction cup and other ending in a gunbarrel.
It is this latter that it starts to fire at you, at the same time it hollers, in an eerie, screeching voice:
“Exterminate!! EX-TER-MI-NATE!!!”

*Feats: Personal Firearms Proficiency, Advanced Firearms Proficiency.

The Daleks were once human-like creatures, but over countless generations they have degenerated into slimy tentacled creatures the size of a small dog. Because this form is -at times- useless, they have used their technology to develop devastating weaponry and means to compensate for this.
On their home universes, they are one of the more ‘ultimate’ threats one can face, relentless, cold-blooded, outright aggressive. Their goal is to completely dominate the universe-and exterminate any and all resistance to this goal.

On Coreline, several of the Daleks have seen the Time War, or heard of it, heard of how they were nearly annihilated, along with the Gallifreyians. Although there’s a small number of them that had considered the lesson behind said event and have decided to live a more calm life (although, admittedly, it just seems impossible that they would be able to), the vast majority of them had decided to go and attempt to conquer Coreline. Their numbers -all things considered- are small, but they ARE determined. They WILL make an attempt.

And anything that stands in the way… it will be exterminated.

*Dalek Travel Machine: Crew 1, Pass 0, Cargo 0lb, Init -6, Man -4, Top Spd 40', Def 10, Hard 20, hp 40, Sz M, Purch DC N/A, Rest N/A

The travel machine is a pepperpot-shaped case about 1.5 metres tall.
The machine has a wheeled base. The top of the machine is a rotating turret with a single eyestalk. A manipulator arm and a weapon arm are mounted on the front of the machine. Within the machine is a power plant, a computer linked into the mutants' communication network, and life-support systems that will prolong the mutant's life even in deep space for weeks. Machines are also mounted with electronic voiceboxes that convert the thoughts of the mutant into spoken form.

The travel machine is slowed to half speed on mildly uneven ground, and cannot maneuver at all across severely uneven ground (such as a staircase). However, recently some travel machines have had hover engines installed that allow hover movement at full normal speed (Clumsy maneuvering). These hover engines can only sustain this movement for a maximum of 10 rounds before needing to be recharged, but usually this is enough to go up a flight of stairs to continue extermination.

The weapon arm is typically a Dalek Laser Cannon. The Dalek Laser Cannon can be used on either Stun or Lethal setting. Recently, some Dalek Machines have also been seen equipped with a 5.56mm belt-fed machine gun instead of the laser (the reason behind this switch is unknown-probably their laser was damaged).

*Dalek Laser Cannon, Stun Setting: Any target hit that fails a Fort Save DC12 is rendered Unconscious for 2d6 minutes; otherwise, that target is Stunned for 1d4 rounds. Type Energy, Range 40'; RoF Single, Mag N/A; Sz M

*Dalek Laser Cannon, Lethal Setting: Any target that fails a Fort Save DC12 is instantly disintegrated; otherwise, that target is Stunned for 2d4 rounds. Type Energy, Range 40'; RoF Single, Mag N/A; Sz M

*5.56mm Machine Gun: Dam 2d8, Crit 20, Type Ballistic, Range 80', RoF A, Mag Linked, Sz M.

COMBAT: Rank-and-file Dalek tactics are simple: see something that is non-Dalek, shriek 'EXTERMINATE!!!' and roll towards it, cannon blazing. If given a group of targets, their priority will be any Gallifreyian in the group, and if it's a Time Lord, they will hunt him down in earnest. The fact that they like to attack in groups is also a bad thing.
Some Daleks will be smarter than that, just stunning or wounding an enemy and making a trap for the rest, but bear in mind that this is an exception.

'Now was that civilized, no clearly not, it was fun, but it wasn't civilized.'

Gremlins are evil, almost reptilian fey with a mischivious streak.
A gremlin is a roughly 3' tall reptilian looking humanoid, with green scaly skin and yellow or red glowing eyes. It's large mouth is filled with sharp teeth, and it's threefingered class end in wicked claws. A gremlin has very short legs, and disproportionately long arms. All known gremlins are male.
Gremlins revel in destruction and mayhem trying their best to bring chaos to order, often destroying innumerable magical treasures, libraries, shops, buildings, inns, and bakeries, in their attempts.

Combat:
Gremlins rely on their often superior numbers to overrun their opponents. They seem not to understand that they can get killed though, and often keep on attacking until they are dead. There are reports of gremlins that keep on fighting even when half their bodies have been destroyed.
Sunlight Vulnerability (Ex): A gremlin melts in direct sunlight taking 1d8 points of damage each round it is exposed to it. A Daylight spell however will not damage a gremlin, although it will repel it.
Water Birth (Ex): If a gremlin is exposed to liquid water (not ice or snow, or even steam) it will start to bubble as many tiny gremlins start to gestate just under it's skin. This process takes 1d4 minutes to complete and is quite painful to the gremlin dealing it 1d4 points of subdual damage each minute. When this process is finished, the end result is 2d4 new adult gremlins.

Gremlin Characters:
Gremlins rarely live long enough to take levels in a character class, much due to their often self-destructive behavior. Those few that do, however, favor the rogue class. And most gremlin leaders are rogues or rogue/fighters.

Other Types of Gremlins:
A large number of gremlin subspecies have been reported over the years, here is a small list, the list is by no means complete as gremlins are highly mutagenic:

Bat Gremlin
A bat gremlin resembles the normal gremlin, but have large wings like those of a bat as well as blindsight 30'. If that isn't enough to make this creature a deadly threat, it also lacks the sunlight vulnerability of other gremlins. Fortunatly it's practically blind, and can only differentiate between light and dark.

Fifinella
The fifinella is the legendary female gremlin, the only difference between the fifinella and the regular gremlin other than their gender, is the fifinellas slighly higher int score.

Genious Gremlin
The genious gremlin as the name implies is a gremlin with exceptional intelligence. They are often smarter than humans and elves (Int 13+). These intelligent gremlins usually lead their lesser kin.

Mogwai
These tiny furry gremlins are usually of good alignment. If they eat between midnight and dawn they transform into the common gremlin.

Spider Gremlin
These large gremlins resemble driders in appearance, they are many times more powerfull than their lesser kin and are able to cast web at will. The spider gremlin is of large size and have 4 HD.

Plant Gremlin
The plant gremlin is just that, a plant. It resembles the common gremlin, but is entirely made up of vegetable matter.


Following are the three kinds of zombie:the common 'slow' zombie (a.k.a. the 'Romero'-class), the 'turbo' zombie (a.k.a. the 'Boyle'-class, a reference to '28 Days Later'), and the 'smart' zombie (the 'Bub'-class, one that, considering its rareness, has become a sort of 'leader' among other zombies).

Common Zombie: Medium undead; HD 2d12; hp 13; Init -1; Spd 10 ft.; Defense 9, touch 9, flat-footed 9; BAB +0; Grap +1; Atk +1 melee (1d6+1, slam) or bite (1d3+1 plus infection); Full Atk +1 melee (1d6, slam) or bite (1d3+1 plus infection); FS 5 ft. by 5 ft.; Reach 5 ft.; SA Infection; SQ undead, headshot vulnerability, light fascination, move or attack action only; AL none; SV Fort +0, Ref -1, Will +3; AP 0; Rep +0; Str 13, Dex 8, Con -, Int 3, Wis 10, Cha 1.

NOTES

Action Points: Zombies have no Action Points.

Headshot Vulnerability (all): Zombies only suffer one-third damage from crushing, piercing, slashing, or ballistic damage done to any parts of their bodies other than their heads. Attacks which damage a zombie in the head automatically do triple damage. Specifically aiming attacks at a zombie's head suffers a -4 "to hit" penalty. For random shots, 1 in 10 successful attacks hits in the head. Other forms of damage, such as fire or electricity, damage zombies as normal and are not modified.

Infection (all): Each time a human is bitten by a zombie, the human must make a Fortitude save against a DC equal to 15 + damage of the attack. (For example, a 3 point bite is DC 18). Those failing this check become inflected and start loosing 1 Constitution point per hour. At Constitution 0, the human turns into a zombie equal to the type which started the infection (common, turbo or smart). Inflected humans do not become worse if additional damage is done after the initial infection.

Light Fascination (common, turbo): At night, zombies become easily distracted by sudden bright lights. When first exposed to headlights or flares, the zombie must make a Will save vs. DC 10 or become fascinated, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the light, for as long as the effect lasts. It takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new saving throw against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated zombie, breaks the effect but does not allow the zombie initative that round. A smart zombie may shake a fascinated zombie free of the effect as a standard action.

Move or Attack only (common, smart): Because of their slow nature, zombies can either move or attack in a round, but not both. Turbo zombies may both move and attack normally in a round.

Rally (smart only): A smart zombie can coordinate the actions of common zombies within 30 feet. In such cases, common zombies gain a +1 competence bonus on attacks, Listen and Spot checks, and Will saves. Common zombies under the influence of a smart zombie's rally become immune to Light Fascination, though this weakness immediately returns should they move 30 feet or more away or if the smart zombie is destroyed. Other benefits from this ability will vary; examples may include the smart zombie showing common zombies how to use firearms or leading a pack of common zombies though city streets to a specific location. Turbo zombies cannot be affected by this ability.

Undead (all): Zombies are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, necromantic effects, and mind-affecting effects. They are not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or effects of massive damage, or any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless. Also, zombies cannot heal damage on their own, even if they have an Intelligence score greater than zero. Zombies are destroyed immediately if reduced to 0 hit points or less.




TREMORS: TERRORS OF THE NEVADA DESERT.
These Fiction monsters are (in their core universe) extremely ancient and savage. They roam around the desert, eating everything that gets in the way. During the Hours, they managed to eat almost everything on two small valleys, located on the western Nevada desert, and the Argentinean Ands. Following the Hours, there was no attempt by them to leave the areas (again, CLULESS might have given them ‘behavioural modification’ of some sort).



GRABOID: CR 8; Huge Aberration; HD 12d8+60; hp 114; Mas 21; Init +0; Spd burrow 40 ft.; Defence 20 (-2 size, +1 Dex, +11 natural); BAB +7; Grap +15; Full Atk +15 melee (1d6+12, 3 slams); FS 10 ft. by 20 ft.; Reach 10 ft. (tentacles); SA improved grab, swallow whole; SQ tremorsense, metamorphosis; SV Fort +9, Ref +5, Will +9; AP 0; Rep +0; Str 26, Dex 12, Con 21, Int 3, Wis 12, Cha 3.
Skills: Listen +10, Spot +10.
Feats: Alertness, Multiattack.
Advancement: 13-16 HD (Huge); 17-24 HD (Gargantuan).

Graboids are about thirty feet long and worm-like, and push their way through the soil with short, but incredibly strong, cilia-like appendages. Inside their bony, beak-like mouths, they have three long tentacles with smaller mouths that can bite and slap.

Combat
Graboids can sense anything that has any form of contact with the ground, and will attack it as a source of food. After consuming a concentration of nutrients, the graboid will advance 1 HD.

Improved Grab (Ex): A graboid has to hit with at least one slam attack for it to be able to initiate a grapple without provoking an attack of opportunity.
Swallow Whole (Ex): A graboid can swallow anything of Medium-size or smaller that it grabs. A swallowed creature takes 3d6 acid damage and 3d6 crushing damage each round. A graboid’s gullet has an AC of 20 and 15 hit points, and can be cut with a light slashing weapon.
Metamorphosis (Ex): After advancing to maximum HD, a graboid undergoes a painful transformation; 6 shriekers break out of the graboid’s body, killing the creature instantly.


SHRIEKER: CR 7; Medium-size Aberration; HD 5d8+10; hp 38; Mas 16; Init +3; Spd 40 ft.; Defence 19 (+3 Dex, +6 natural) touch 14, flat-footed 17; BAB +3; Grap +4; Full Atk +5 melee (2d4+3, bite); FS 5 ft. by 5 ft.; Reach 5 ft.; SA improved grab; SQ heat sense, metamorphosis; SV Fort +3, Ref +4, Will +5; AP 0; Rep +0; Str 14, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 3.
Skills: Jump +6, Spot +11.
Feats: Alertness.
Advancement: 6-8 HD (Medium-size).

Shriekers are about knee-high and five feet long, with the same bony mouth of the graboid, but shriekers have two muscular legs to run along the ground instead of tunnelling. They have only one sense: infrared sight. They cannot hear, they cannot touch, and they apparently cannot feel. Their nick-name came from the powerful shriek they deal out when they give their ‘rally call’-actually a powerful thermal flare.

Combat
Shriekers seem smart, but that’s because they’re so dumb. They’ll attack any heat source, including vehicle engines and radio transmission stations, and try to consume them. After eating a certain concentration of nutrients (equivalent to one concentrated ready-to-eat meal), a Shrieker can reproduce, creating a Tiny 1 HD shrieker.

Heat Sense (Ex): Shriekers see only infrared, and thus only see heat sources. Shriekers ignore anything that does not give off heat, and will only attack hot objects.
Metamorphosis (Ex): After 12 hours, a shrieker will change into an assblaster if it has consumed enough food to advance it to 8 HD.


ASSBLASTER: CR 8; Medium-size Aberration; HD 8d8+24; hp 66; Mas 17; Init +3; Spd 30 ft., fly 30 ft. (clumsy); Defence 20 (+3 Dex, +7 natural); BAB +6; Grap +11; Full Atk +11 melee (2d4+5, bite); FS 5 ft. by 10 ft.; Reach 5 ft.; SA improved grab; SQ ass blast, explosive, heat sense; SV Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +6; AP 0; Rep +0; Str 20, Dex 16, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 3.
Skills: Jump +11, Spot +13.
Feats: Alertness.
Advancement: 9-12 HD (Medium-size).

An ‘evolution’ of the Shrieker, the Assblaster is its ‘final stage’- made to move on to a far territory and lay its progeny. The ‘Death from above’ part is a benefit that they like to exploit, as well.
Assblasters resemble sinuous Shriekers with leathery wings. In order to fly, the assblaster has to excrete an acid from its behind that explodes on contact with air, propelling it skyward.

Combat
Assblasters are similar to Shriekers in that they seem smart because they’re dumb. They attack only heat sources, and attempt to consume them. After eating a certain concentration of nutrients, an assblaster can grow an egg, which it buries in soft soil. After a great deal of time (more than 300 years), the egg hatches into a graboid.

Ass Blast (Ex): As a move-equivalent action, an assblaster can blast, sending it airborne and allowing it to fly at a speed of 30 feet (clumsy) for up to 1 minute. The explosion causes 3d6 points of fire damage to anything directly behind the creature.
Explosive (Ex): The acids that assblasters use to fly are extremely volatile; if the creature takes more than 6 points of fire damage in one round, it explodes, inflicting 3d6 fire damage to everything within 10 feet, and 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage to everything within 40 feet.
Heat Sense (Ex): Assblasters see only infrared, and thus only see heat sources. Assblasters ignore anything that does not give off heat, and will only attack hot objects.



A New Species (thanks to Michael Tresca).
HUMAN-XENOMORPH HYBRID ('Bug-Juiced').

The Xenomorphs. There is one Fiction species out there that has never been renamed, and for due reason. They are so deadly, that renaming them would be useless. On their home universes, there’s been many attempts to clone them, control them, or use them as weapons in any way.
One of such ways has been human experimentation, creating hybrids that would be (theoretically) smart, strong, destructive and loyal. Of course, this is *theoretically*.
The hybrids are driven by primitive instinct (standard Xenomorph behavior: protect Queen and Hive, find resources for the Hive to expand), which more often than not are *way* too disconcerting to be used in the field alongside other humans (and even some Fiction species find them just as unsettling). That they can ‘feel’ Xenomorphs and are registered as ‘do not attack’ on the Xeno’s senses helps even less.
On Coreline, they are a tight bunch. The ‘Earth Hive’, they call themselves, after an Aliens comic. Their desire is to be left alone.
Of course, that is because if angered, the part of them that is a Xeno might strike back.

Racial Stats:
*+2 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Con, -2 Wis, -2 Cha.
*Medium-Size.
*Base Speed: 30 Ft.
*-2 to Diplomacy rolls: Xenomorphic instincts don’t give much in talkative desires.
*Acid Blood: Whenever a physical attack hurts a Hybrid, there is a chance for acid blood to do ‘splash damage’. The DC for the Reflex save (anyone within 5 feet of the Hybrid) is equal to the damage made (divide by ½ if it’s a bludgeoning or piercing weapon). Damage from acid damage is 1d6 per 6 points made (round down), to a maximum of 10d6. Any item exposed to the spray must make a save vs. the DC of the amount of damage made (Mastercraft items get a +5 to the save). Failure destroys the item.
*Unusual Physiology: Attempts to use Treat Injury on the Hybrid have a -4 penalty (unless they have the Xenomedic Feat). In addition, all items used must be custom-made to withstand the acidic blood.
*Fast Healing: Hybrids have Fast Healing 1.
*Xeno-Sense: Whenever a Hybrid is within a mile of a Xenomorph, they may make a Wisdom check (DC 35-1 per Xenomorph within that range). If this succeeds, the Hybrid is aware of its presence, but gain no extra details of its location beyond a generic direction and range (‘It’s that way, near/far’).
*Ignored Target: A Xenomorph will ignore a Hybrid until the Hybrid attacks it.
*Impregnation Immunity: Hybrids cannot be infested by Xenomorphs.
*Level Adjustment: +3.

YAUJTA




Their species is called the ‘Yaujta’ (in their language meaning the ‘survivors’), but almost all the other species know them by other name: the ‘Predators’. This race of humanoid reptilians has grown into becoming one of the nastiest hunters out there. For them, honor and the Hunter’s Code is everything. For hundreds of years, they saw all other species out there as prey-and Humans, with their increasing use of balancing technology and ever-present ability to adapt to survive, were one of their most coveted prizes.
On Coreline, the situation quickly became something different. They were one of many Fiction races to appear, and although a good deal of them went on a rampage at the view of such exotic prizes, others decided to hang back and scout the scene. Those who went on rampages were quickly eliminated by prey that they underestimated, and the humongous number of Yaujta that died during the 23 Hours (not to mention the number of destroyed neighborhoods that came from some of them doing the ‘spoil-sport’ thing) made it understandable to the Yaujta society: if the Hunt was to continue on Coreline, it would be necessary to understand all new Prey, and more important, what advantages the common Prey now had. And so, they laid low.
Cue some time later. The Yaujta integrated into society, and although the Spirit of the Hunt and its Code is one thing that will never truly fade away, some of them had found that living just for it was an extremely quick way to gain bad rep, enemies (and possibly getting fragged) in this world. Those Yaujta that make a honest living do so as bounty hunters, trackers, guides and even park rangers. Those who don’t are hired muscle, assassins and plain psycho killers.

RACIAL TRAITS:
*+4 Str, +2 Con, -2 Int, -4 Cha.
*Large-Sized Monstrous Humanoids.
*Base Speed of 30 feet. The Yaujta’s speed is not reduced by brush, foliage or broken terrain.
*+2 Natural Defense Bonus: Yaujta have tough, leathery skin.
*Unusual Vision: The Yaujta can see in only one spectrum of light: infra-red. While it’s a superior spectral range, this vision, however, has poor resolution. A Yaujta effectively has Darkvision, and can ignore all concealment penalties, but they have a -2 species penalty to Spot checks. This penalty increases to -4 if the object in question is not moving
*Energy Resistance 5 to Fire, Electrical, Acid and Radiation damage.
*Cold Sensitive: Yaujta take an additional 2 points of subdual damage per die of cold damage they suffer. If a save allows the cold damage to be reduced, the same reduction applies to this additional damage.
*+1 species bonus to Climb checks and Strength, for purposes of how much can the Yaujta lift or carry. This bonus raises by 1 every four levels.
*Free Languages: Yaujta.
*Level Adjustment: +3.



NEW RACE:

TSUFURU-JIN.


Tsufuru-Jin in Gunfight, Picture Taken in Seattle during the 23 Hours.

Long ago the Tsufuru-jin lived peacefully on their planet called Planet Plant. They possessed a very advanced civilization, and lived in high-tech cities across the planet. By contrast, their neighbors, the Saiyans, were a rugged race of barbarians who resided in the wastelands. Living in small clans, the Saiyans were never much of a threat at large, even though they were much larger and stronger than the Tsufuru-jin. For untold centuries, the two native races of the planet lived side-by-side. That is, until the Saiyans decided to attack. The Saiyans declared war on the Tsufuru-jin, and although the Saiyans were physically much stronger, the Tsufuru-jin's technology meant they were on an equal grounds.

But then a factor came in that gave the Saiyans a major advantage. The full moon came up, an event that only happened on the planet once every 100 years. The Saiyans had an ability that made them turn into giant apes called O-zaru whenever they were exposed to moonlight. In their transformed state, Saiyans became ten times more powerful. After they had all transformed, they easily defeated the Tsufuru-jin. They took over the planet and renamed it Vegeta, after their king. When the Tsufuru-jin were all wiped out, the Saiyans adopted their technology and began to expand into space, becoming a race of space pirates.

A large number of Tsufuru-Jin appeared on Coreline, confused as all Hell for the events happening around them. The massive proliferation of SPBs (and being outnumbered by the amount of Saiyans that appeared as well) made them quite reliant to help anybody during the beginning part of the 23 Hours, and those who made alliances did it only for the sake of survival.
Once the smoke cleared, the Tsufuru-Jin found out that they were nothing but Fictions, and again they were on an equal grounds with the Saiyans in one aspect: they both became refugees from a dead planet. And they were here to stay, for better or worse.

A Tsufuru-Jin is a humanoid built in a compact fashion, on the border between Medium and small (the average Tsufuru-Jin is between five-two and five-five feet tall). They all have the customary Toriyama Fiction ‘rugged appearance’, although they are seemingly more fragile than the Saiyans. Aside from access to more advanced technology, the knowledge to produce and maintain it, and an almost innate knowledge of how to hurt (HARD) a Saiyan (no doubt the result of the war), they are no different from a run-of-the-mill human.

RACIAL STATS:
Tsufuru-Jin are as per rulebook humans, with the following additions:
*Tsufuru-Jin obtain a +2 bonus to all attack rolls involving Saiyans.
*Tsufuru-Jin obtain the ‘Blooded’ Feat for free.
*Tsufuru-Jin obtain a +2 bonus to one technical skill of the player’s choice.



I'm done with the Quadrillians.

Quadrillian
Information from Zap! FAQs: The Quadrillian race, named so because of their distinct 4-armed anatomy, is a ritualistic race of people. Having just recently discovered interstellar travel, their species is not often found on planets other than their own Quadrillia. Quadrillia was once a planet covered in rivers and lakes, but after a catastrophic meteor slammed into their world, most of the surface water had been evaporated. The main source of water now is found in deep, underground rivers. The sudden disappearance of all of this water has left the surface of the planet seeming scarred by deep craters and steep ravines where the lakes and rivers once flowed. The meteor crash also wiped out many of the plants and animals that roamed the surface, thus the Quadrillian species had to resort to becoming a wandering group of tribes. Many battles were fought between tribes for territories that had water, and our lovable Grontar is a member of a certain tribe that had a particularly large amount of territory and power. So much, in fact, that they had given up the migrations and settled near the Crack of Bezod, a large series of ravines and crags which was the home for the vicious beast Bezod. The men of Grontar's tribe, once reaching the age of adulthood, would fight Bezod. If they returned alive, they became men. As far as recent events are concerned, the GEF have been trying to acquire Quadrillia for several reasons. Firstly, the GEF feels they can enslave the Quadrillians as grunt soldiers, and secondly, Quadrilla is made almost entirely out of Oridium; an ore that is often used to create the blast shield in intergalactic cruisers. The elder Quadrillians have done well so far at keeping the advance troops at bay, but it is only a matter of time before the GEF sends too many soldiers for the tribes to defeat, seperated as they are.
Extra Data for Dark Earth Setting: During the 23 hours, a group of Quadrillians landed in the Outback of Australia. They have set up a colony there, and often trade with the native Aborigines. Although the GEF wound up all the way in Europe, the Quadrillian immigrants still have a fear that they might be hunted down like they were in their own world.
Species Traits
Quadrillians share the following species traits:
Type: Giant.
Size: Large.
Ability Modifiers: +4 Strength, +2 Constitution, -2 Wisdom.
Speed: 30 feet.
Armor Restrictions: Quadrillians can't wear armor made for other species. Add +2 to the Purchase DC of any piece of armor tailored for a Quadrillian.

Free Language Skills: Read/Write and Speak English and Quadrillian.
Level Adjustment: +1.

Urban Drider
A completely different branch in the species tree from the cavern-dwelling Driders of old, the species known as Urban Driders are city folks that can be an arachnophobic's nightmare. While some may indeed be peaceful, that doesn't make them liked anymore from the spider haters of the world. They still resemble the classic Drider frame of a spider's abdomen and a Drow waist up, but are quite unique in their habits and habitat. There are several subspecies of Urban Drider, each having a slightly different spider body. The following subspecies can be found below: Widow, Wolfin, Tarntalas, Netcatch, and Hopper.
Urban Drider Species Traits
Size: Small for male, Large for female. Urban Driders follow the common pattern of spiders.
Ability Modifiers: Female +2 Constitution, +2 Strength, -4 Charisma. Male +2 Constitution, -4 Charisma, +2 Dexterity.
Base Speed: 30 feet for Widow, Tarntalas, and Netcatch Urban Driders, 40 feet for Hoppers and Wolfins.
Spider Climb: Urban Driders can always move as if they have the spider climb spell on.
Darkvision (Wolfin and Netcatch): Wolfin and Netcatch Urban Driders have darkvision as per Dwarves. Hopper, Tarntalas, and Widow Urban Driders have low-light vision instead.
Skill Bonuses: All Urban Driders gain a +2 on Spot checks. Hoppers gain a +2 to Jump checks and Wolfins gain a +2 to Search.
Web: Urban Driders can produce webs as per monstrous spiders.

Limaph
"I have seen the fall of empires and the murder of millions! I have shoved that data into files like so many numbers! I have seen a great many things, but little as ignorant and dangerous as a conceited little girl who has used so-called "spiritual devices" to turn her own unbridled ID into a demon capable of killing the one she's too stupid to realize she loves!"

Some celestials war on the front lines, others act as nature's wards, but few are so important as the Limaphim. A typical Limaph stands around 5'8"-6'0" in height, built like amazingly fit humanoids with elven ears and snowy white hair. From their backs sprout two huge dove-like wings, capable of being concealed from humans at will. The Limaphim control a form of magic beyond most others: a massive databank of the universe's inhabitants and their personal data. A mere misplacement of a file can result in destructive consequences. While most Limaphim dwell in Asgard, some live on Coreline Earth itself due to either missions or banishment. While they are not combatants, a Limaph is never unarmed, and can perform the job of the Seraphim as a warrior in a spot, especially the Holy Warriors (Strong Hero 4/Fast Hero 4/Holy Knight 5).

Crawling Eye
Large, bulbous, and ugly, Crawling Eyes are rare mountain-dwelling organisms that can only survive in the very uppermost portions of the world such as the peaks of the Andes and Everest. Looking like giant eyeballs with tentacles (No tentacle monster jokes!), they are ferociously defensive of their territory, and even more defensive against psions: the Eyes, for reasons unknown, seem to despise psionic powers within their vicinity. Crawling Eyes decapitate their prey, and have the ability to control dead bodies as zombies.

Bioships

Living space craft, sentient creatures that travel the stars as easily as terrestrial wales traverse the seas, some times taking on crews to act as companions, and deal with unpleasant surprises.
+4 LA
+20 STR, +10 CON
Hit die: d20
BAB: 3/4 Hit dice
Good saves: Fort
Skills: (6+int) craft(int), Biogeneration(con), Pilot(Dex, self only) Navigate(int), survival(wis), swim(str).

Blind sight(ex): The biological equivalent of a class (IV) (or better) sensor system gives them Blind sight 500' while in atmosphere.

Energy Resistance(ex): cold resistance 20, fire 20

Radiation resistance(ex): +8 fort saves VS radiation

Vacuum survival(ex): Bioships suffer no ill effects from being in an airless environment.

Biothrusters(ex): while in atmosphere bioships have fly 200' average, but their base tactical speed(with thrusters) is 2000

Hardness(ex): a bioship's inorganic carapace gives them a Hardness of 15, if they for any reason gain DR, they instead gain an equivalent bonus to their hardness.

Biogeneration(ex): Bioships may consciously grow biological equivalents to communications systems, most defense systems, some engines, and energy weapons appropriate to an ultralight ship of the same hit dice. they must make an appropriate craft check and then a biogeneration check equal to the systems purchase DC. the time taken to grow the system is same as if they were to build it from scratch.
+Biogeneration is always in class
+any point where a system created this way would use a computer use check, they instead use a survival check; if they would use a repair check, they instead use a biogeneration check.
+weapons created this way are natural weapons, they provide extra attacks as such.
+only the bioship itself may use these systems.
+photon sails, induction, inertial flux, and spatial compressors are the allowed engines.
+autopilots, point defense, chaff, and decoy launchers are prohibited.

Filter feeding(ex): Bioships may survive for years at a time on interstellar hydrogen, if they "land" on a planet, they will splash down and consume plankton in the oceans. while feeding like on plankton they heal a biogeneration check divided by 5 HP each day, and recover ability damage as if at bed rest.

Player characters are always young adults or adults.

Once they are of Adult age they are capable of breeding.
A typical Bioship ordinary will have additional levels in the base classes equal to twice their racial class level.

Bioships are interstellar mollusks. they mate for life and lay their eggs (2D6) in sheltered oceanic coves. For their firstwi fifteen years they are unable to fly and have 1/10 fly speed as swim speed. After about 16 years they are able to fly bu not achieve orbit. Once they become young adults they leave the nursery world and typically join a trade caravan with their parents. Throughout this time they are educated by their parents. By the time they are young adults they can typically produce an FTL drive (at least with some help).


Knowledge(history) DC 30 (15 if made by a bioship)
The race known simply as bioships were once merely oceanbound sentient mollusks but advanced their skills in biotechnology to the point where they as a whole altered themselves to the creature we know today.

Knowledge(history) DC 35 (15 if made by a bioship)
Even today some of the first to undergo the genetic treatments to become bioships (in fact the inventors there of), are still alive today. Bioships have the most advanced biotechnology of any race known on the trade ways.

Knowledge(civics) DC 15
Bioships are nomadic (people), they rarely stay in one place for more than a few decades. They will sometimes adopt an allegiance to humanoid nation for a similar amount of time. they spend most of their time traveling with trade caravans.

Knowledge(civics) DC 30 (15 if made by a bioship)
The bioship race in fact has a government of their own. It is slow in action and loose with enforcement but is strong and well supported, those civilizations who anger it alway disappear within a century. The officials are always elders and older.


Technological level.
Player Bioships are usually educated to the point of pl 7 or 8 technology.
The bioship government is currently at the far side of PL9, this discrepancy is because those bioships who are no part of the government are educated only by their parents. Bioships will attend their form of university as they become greater adults and gain full access to PL9 tech.
They are native to the Triangulum Galaxy. Their government, universities, military, and most of their "colonies" exist there and this fact is kept well hidden. they are the only space ferrying intelligent life forms native to that galaxy.
Their colonies are used mostly to store herd of their war machines and forests of Brain trees that cat as their computers.

Brine Brute
These primeval beasts, similar to the Canadian Real fossil creature known as anomalocaris, are natives to the American Southwest. They usually lie dormant for indefinate amounts of time in the desert sands, but if an area is flooded, they will awaken and begin their age-old hunting routines. Brine brutes are quite dangerous to smaller boats, and many recreationists in Lake Powell have been devoured by these ambush monsters. While deadly in the water, once on land, brine brutes are somewhat sluggish.

Rhedosaurus
In its own realm of the Fiction films Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Planet of Dinosaurs and the Fiction comic book Return to Mysterious Island, Rhedosaurus was a hulking 40-foot king of the monitor lizards, nigh unstoppable against humanoids and even some other giant beasts. In Coreline, however, the population of Rhedosaurus in existence are relatively easy to deal with. This lies with the fact that the one substance that renders their heavy defenses helpless is quite common in modern militaries: nuclear weaponry. There are estimated to have been about 9 Rhedosaurus created by CLULESS, now dwindled to 5. One individual was crushed by Zilla Jr. when it attempted to attack NYC, another slain by the Justice League near Mt. Kilimanjaro, and a breeding pair was killed by a Kamacuras swarm in a battle for territory on Monster Island. The remaining 5 can be found in the following locations and status by current estimates:
KDF HQ; frozen in stasis field for study.
Papua New Guinea rainforests; healthy and doing the military's job of hunting down mutant humanoids and beasts.
Congo Jungle; considered a nuisance due to its depletion of elephant and Mokele-Mbembe populations.
Washington, DC; A younger individual that is being trained with some success by KDF to act as a "partner" to Zilla Jr. in monster fights.
Australian Outback; harassing the tassie tigers and other creaturefolk to no end. Might be cause for concern to humans in the future.

Gojiras-The Monster Kings
Along with the American mega-monster Zilla Jr., the Gojira species make up species typically called "Godzillas" by the general public and even some of the KDF (who should really know better than to make such a generalization). There are currently three survivors of the Gojira breed: Heisei Gojira, Showa Gojira, and Gojira 2000. Gojira 2000 is the most modern incarnation and the most active, often attacking monsters that appear in its chosen territory of coastal Asia. Heisei Gojira is considered the more dangerous of the two "romp and stomps" by the KDF, also taking down monsters it perceives as territorial adversaries (but instead staking out Indonesia as its home) but having the less than savory aspect of often attacking human settlements out of rage when it has the monstrous equivalent of a hissyfit. Showa Gojira is the "nicest" of the group, and prefers to keep itself on Monster Island, only appearing outside when it feels it needs to defend Japan. Most militaries know about Gojiras, and have branches of the KDF meant for defense against the titans. Sydney, Australia, in specific has a large KDF force after their unprepared city's destruction early on by Heisei Gojira ripping the American beast Zilla into atoms. Zilla's offspring, KDF's smart and monster-beating Zilla Jr. isn't nearly as weak or as stupid, but is still considered too far from being out of its juvenile growth cycle to be large and strong enough to take on Heisei.

Gojira: CR ?; Colossal dragon; HD 43d12+476; Hp 755; Mas 32; Init +4 (Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft., swim 20 ft.; Defense 31, touch 2, flat-footed 31 (-8 size, +29 natural); BAB +43; Grap +71; Atk +48 melee (4d8+12, bite) or +42 melee (3d10+6, tail bash); Full atk +48 melee (4d8+12, bite) and +42 melee (2d12+6, slam) or +42 melee (3d10+6, tail bash); FS 60 ft. by 60 ft.; Reach 60 ft.; SQ Breath weapon, darkvision 60ft., DR 18/cold, fire subtype, hold breath (10 x Con modifier), low-light vision, radiation; AL none; SV Fort +36, Ref +23.

Skills: Climb +44, Intimidate +20, Listen +11, Speak Draconic, Spot +11, Survival +41, Swim +52.
Feats: Athletic, Awesome Blow, Blind Fighting, Cleave, Die Hard, Endurance, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Toughness, Track, Weapon Focus (Bite).
Advancement: -
Breath Weapon (Ex): Once per 1d8 rounds, Gojira can unleash a 100-foot cone of energy that deals 4d10 points of fire damage as well as immediately exposing the target to high radiation sickness. Any creature caught in the beam may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 Gojira's HD + Gojira's Constitution modifier) to half the damage.
Radiation (Ex): The area within 60 feet of Gojira is considered highly irradiated. Gojira is thus immune to other forms of radiation.

NOTES: For Showa Gojira, increase the Intelligence score to 8 and give it throw rocks as per the giant ability. Gojira 2000 has its base speed and swim speed increased by 10. Heisei Gojira is unchanged from the base form, save for gaining the following ability:
Nuclear Meltdown (Su): When severely damaged, Heisei Gojira's heart begins going into a nuclear meltdown. After it reaches 1/3 hp, its radiation exuding is considered to go from highly to severely irradiated. Upon death, Heisei Gojira explodes with violent force of nuclear mass meltdown, dealing 500 points of damage to anything within 400 feet and 200 points of damage to anything within a mile. A Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 Heisei Gojira's Hit Dice + Heisei Gojira's Dexterity Modifier) to half the damage (yeeeah...like that's going to keep your butt from being atomized with such a high damage count). When the atomic bomb-reminiscent apocalyptic mushroom cloud subsides, there is a half-mile crater in the center of the fallout radius that is considered severely irradiated. The other half-mile is considered highly irradiated. While Heisei is the only incarnation known to perform this Apocalypse event thanks to Godzilla vs. Destroyah, and Showa is known to definitely NOT do so, the GM may optionally give Gojira 2000 the Nuclear Meltdown special quality.

#########
I went back and gave Gojira's breath weapon a slight makeover and added a note that he is immune to radiation. After reading William Tsutsui's Godzilla on my Mind: 50 Years with the King of Monsters, I've gone an a whole kaiju kick. Expect many giant terrors filling the bestiary. Now that I have done the King, I guess the Evil Emperor and Queen are next up. First, we get the Evil Emperor, that ever-present figure of the Reaper from the Stars: King Ghidorah.

King Ghidorah-Death on the Wing
An ever-present beast in the shadows, a specter of the horrors of deep space, a dragon of the cosmos that never truly rests: all of these have been used to describe King Ghidorah. Speculated as potentially being even stronger than Gojira, King Ghidorah has never surfaced on Coreline Earth yet, but he has been infrequently reported as being glimpsed out of the corner of the eyes of Fictions from the Gundam, Star Wars, and Warhammer 40K universes. Most psychologists write these sightings off as a residual effect of King Ghidorah being seen as space's Grim Reaper, but in truth, the sightings are all too terrifyingly real. This grand beast is responsible for the complete obliteration of Soul Society's Outpost Raion near Tatooine, an event which caused fears amongst the Jedi Academy that Dark Lord of the Sith Lumiya had recreated a Death Star, despite the lack of any schematics and materials for her to do so. Ghidorah can create buffeting wing gusts, has twin smashing tails, and three heads that can blast lightning, not to mention the ability to survive in vacuum, fly, and potentially produce rudimentary psionics. Stronger, more powerful, more endurant...one must wonder the question of whether the Gojiras, battered and bruised from infighting and humanoid forces, can take on this beast when it finally does reach Coreline.
King Ghidorah: CR ?; Colossal dragon; HD 45d12+633; Hp 925; Mas 38; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 30 ft,, fly 250 ft.

Feats: Awesome Blow, Blind Fighting, Cleave, Die Hard, Endurance, Flyby Attack, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Natural Armor, Improved Overrun, Iron Will, Power Attack, Snatch, Toughness, Weapon Focus(Bite).
Advancement: -
Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d8 rounds, King Ghidorah can unleash a violent 100-foot line of electrical "gravity beam" from each head. A successful strike deals 4d10 points of damage. Any creature caught in the beam may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 King Ghidorah's HD + King Ghidorah's Constitution modifier) to half the damage.
Energy Resistance (Ex): King Ghidorah has fire and cold resistance 20.
Radiation Resistance (Ex): As a kaiju used to apocalyptic blazes of radiation, King Ghidorah gains a +8 species bonus to saves against radiation poisoning.
Vacuum Survival (Ex): King Ghidorah has an alien biology that seems to bypass the need for lungs, allowing him to live and move in the vacuum of space without any ill side-effects.

Mothra-Earthmother
One of the legendary three Royal Daikaiju spoken of by Reals and Fictions alike, Mothra is considered an extension of the hand of Coreline itself. She is the defender of humankind, a queen moth of enormous size that has powers of amazing flight for her size, powder-laden wing scales, and grappling claw. While she is the weakest of the Three Royals, she is also one of the most long-lasting. In a life cycle no one but the minuscule Shobijin truly understand, when the current Mothra is either killed or sacrifices herself in defense of Humanity, there are immediately twin Mothra larvae born of an egg in a hidden location in the South Pacific. So, no matter how many times you kill her, Mothra will be back again..and again...and again...to take you down. Moreso than any other kaiju, Mothra's power lies not in physical prowess, but in her sheer intelligence and power to inspire humankind to go the extra mile to defend their homeworld.


Shrewster-Speed Demon
130 feet of insane shrew with a Flash complex, Shrewster is a ferocious monster not by his size or species, but by his sheer speed. Natural attack-wise, Shrewsy is your typical giant monster: he bites, he claws, he leaps like the big rabid water shrew he is. It is his unnatural talent, however, that gives him a defensive edge. When Shrewster runs, he produces wind force that creates a tornado around his body, making him look like some gigantic killer Taz. He is not, however, invulnerable. Zilla Jr. managed to clean his clock by beating the creature senseless until he no longer had the power to produce his speed attack anymore, thus allowing the beast to be sedated and shipped off to Monster Island Preserve (going to be placed into the Coreline Gazette as my next project. Once more, any information in it retconning my previous missing post on monster locations). So far, the defensive shielding has kept the rowdy rodent in, but Shrewster's speed means that he cannot be specially paddocked like the other monsters, lest his lack of movement cause him to go insane. Shrewster has become a popular test subject of Monster Island scientists, since his speed and dexterity seem to defy all logic on how a creature his size should function. It is possible that, despite his upped size, Shrewster has a similar "overdrive metabolism" such as a typical Pre-Vanishing shrew, but instead of working it out in food need like normal shrews, Shrewsy gains energy by actually releasing it: some form of "give and take" in which the more he produces high friction, the more life-sustaining energy his body gets. Others have suggested Shrewster basically acts like a baleen whale, filtering the "air plankton" of various insects and small animals that are snapped into the twister around it.

Mandalorian
When most of the galaxy thinks "Mandalorian", they see the modern mishmash of species in the galaxy. There is a true Mandalorian species, however, one that is rare and hard to find. Also known as the Taung, the true Mandalorian species is like an ever-present shadow in the galaxy, like bogeymen of the stars for children's tales, but frighteningly real. Mandalore the First, Mandalore the Ultimate, and Mandalore the Indomitable are among the (in)famous members of the Taung.

The Eldar Craftworlds



A craftworld is sentient being, with a hundred thousand minds.
-Inquisitor Czevak


Since the time of The Fall, our race has been haunted by what we, in our reckless pursuit of hedonistic indulgence, gave birth to. Though our dreams once overturned worlds and quenched suns, we are now but fitful shadows clinging to the edge of existence.

All the stars in the sky cannot blot out the hateful glare of the Red Moon's Eye. The birthing place of The Great Enemy pulses with all the malice of a daemon that is dreaming, casting its shadow over all we have ever done and all we ever shall. Every twisted strand of Fate and casting of the Runes leads me to this time, to this place, and it is clear that the final battle awaits me at the ancient Crone Worlds.

A conflict the likes of which has not been seen since the Mon-keigh warred amongst themselves, and their corpse of a seer fell to his traitorous son, is coming and all my steps lead towards it, no matter that I walk other paths. I see the stars stained red with the blood of the Mon-Keigh and, though their wars do not concern me and I would gladly let them destroy one another, I know that to avoid this fight is to condemn my race to inevitable doom.

And though all I see is darkness, I know that I will not flinch from my destiny.

- Farseer Eldrad Ulthran of Ulthwé


The Eldar Craftworlds were pulled into Coreline by CLULESS in the final minutes of the 23 Hours. Uniquely, only one copy of any Eldar Craftworld exists in the Coreline universe, and all Eldar have neither Alternates nor Author Madness.

Of course, asking an Eldar WHY this is so is not likely to be a productive venture.

Ask not the Eldar a question, for they will give you three answers, all of which are true and terrifying to know.
-Inquisitor Czevak

The massive Craftworlds, upon learning exactly what had transpired from the psychic babble originating from Earth, began an immediate campaign against the scattered Ork hordes and Chaos Space Marines who were still attempting to figure out what had happened. In the ensuing violence, the Eldar managed to wipe out large portions of the arriving Ork hordes, cutting their numbers down to a size which could no longer threaten to overrun the entire galaxy. Their campaign against Chaos, although less successful, still managed to cut down a sizable force.

After the initial attacks, the 10 Craftworlds relocated to specific points throughout the galaxy, with Craftworld Ulthwé situated in the Sol system, near Saturn. All are still connected through the Webway, and when asked why they chose to distance themselves their only response is:

When there is no other way, the perilous path is the only road to salvation.

It is only hoped that whatever they have foreseen will be shared when the time is right. Hopefully, Coreline will receive their warning better then the Emperor of Man did before the Horus Heresy.


New Race: Eldar.



The story of the Eldar is one of regret and decline. Millennia ago, their race held the galaxy in their grasp. Their power was great; the Eldar could reshape entire worlds by the power of thought alone. Nothing threatened their dominance, and the Eldar began to lose themselves in the decadence of their comfortable existence.

However, their decadent indulgences exacted a terrible price. Unbeknownst to the Eldar, the energy from their depravity had caused increasing disturbances in the Warp. Eventually, these disturbances coallesced into a Chaos god who came to be known as Slaanesh. When Slaanesh was born, the energy from his birthcry travelled through the Warp and obliterated the minds of the majority of the Eldar race.

The few survivors, scattered on craftworlds on the edge of the galaxy, realised what had happened and committed themselves to avoiding the same fate. By devoting themselves to self-discipline, the remaining Eldar avoided the decadent follies of their brethren. Now, the Eldar fight to keep their ancient race from extinction.

Eldar (Humanoid) Species Traits

    * Size: Medium-size.
    * Ability Modifiers: +2 Dex,+2 Int -2 Cha. Eldar are fast and intuitive, but their thought processes are entirely alien from average humanoids.
    * Base Speed: 30 feet.
    * Naturally Psionic: All Eldar have some sense of the power their minds hold, as their entire race has opened their minds to the Warp. Eldar begin with 3 bonus power points at 1st level. This counts as the Wild Talent feat for the purposes of qualifying for advanced classes.
    * Telepathy: Eldar can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet who has a language.
    * Alien Mindset: Eldar have a touch of arrogance, partially understandable since some Eldar have lived longer than Humanity has had a written history. Eldar have a hard time relating to 'lesser' races and have a -4 penalty to Charisma based skills except with other Eldar. This penalty does not apply to the use of Psionic Powers which require a charisma based skill check.

The wall ahead of you shatters into so much dust as a giant, smiling, humanoid figure leaps through. The shining red liquid in his glass body shakes as lets out a bellowing, “Oh, yeaaahhh!”

It’s not known how the Kool-Aid Man was created or whether there are more than one of him. What is known is that wherever fruity drinks of saturated sugar are served, he is there to help out, thanks to his discern location and greater teleport spell-like abilities. Wherever he goes, he enters in dramatic fashion, bursting through walls as though they were wet pasta and letting out a tremendous, “Oh, yeaaahhh!” Despite the mess he leaves, his ability to entertain is unparalleled, with his trademark smile and numerous performing talents. He’s especially well-liked by children, and he’s typically accompanied by a small troop of them soon after he arrives.

Combat
The Kool-Aid man never seeks out a fight, as he’s a fun-loving guy who loves kids and sugar-laced drinks. However, when angered, he is terrifying in battle. His pyrex body grants him great durability, while his saturated sugar metabolism regenerates his wounds extremely quickly. His tremendous strength means that opponents are either bludgeoned to death or dropped bodily into his Kool-Aid filled body, whereby the acidic substance consumes them alive. Furthermore, thanks to his wall explosion and spell-like abilities, there is almost nowhere his enemies can run that he cannot find them.

Wall Explosion (Ex): The Kool-Aid Man receives a +20 competence bonus to burst open walls, so long as he yells out “Oh, yeaaahhh!” after doing so.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the Kool-Aid Man must hit with a slam attack. He can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If wins the grapple check, he establishes a hold and can try to submerge his enemy in the following round.

Submerge (Ex): The Kool-Aid man can submerge a grabbed opponent of Medium size or smaller by making a successful grapple check. A submerged creature is hurled into the Kool-Aid Man’s sugar-filled body, whereby they must make a Fortitude save (DC 20) or be stunned for 1d6 rounds from the sugar rush. In addition, they take 2d6+10 points of acid damage per round while submerged. Creatures killed from this acid damage have their remains consumed one round later, as if by the destruction spell. Creatures that are submerged are still considered grappled while in the Kool-Aid Man’s body, though he gets a -20 penalty on Grapple checks in this circumstance. If unstunned, they may attempt to escape submersion by breaking free of the Kool-Aid Man’s grapple.

The Kool-Aid man can submerge one Medium, four Small, 16 Tiny, or 64 Diminutive or smaller creatures at one time.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will- air walk, discern location, greater teleport, jump. Caster level 20th.

Sugar Rush (Ex): By burning vast quantities of energy from his sugar-soaked metabolism, the Kool-Aid Man can move at terrifying speed. For up to ten rounds per day, he may function as though under the haste spell.

Vulnerable to Shatter (Ex): The Kool-Aid Man counts as a crystalline creature for the purposes of the shatter spell.

Skills: The Kool-Aid man has a +4 racial bonus on Perform (Dance) and Tumble checks.

Treasure
The Kool-Aid Man carries around virtually no possessions, leaving little conventional treasure for would-be thieves. However, the hundred gallons of Kool-Aid filling his frame is supernaturally potent. By withdrawing ten gallons of it from the Kool-Aid man's body, an individual skilled in alchemy can distill it into a thick, syrupy substance. This unholy mixture (sometimes referred to as "leet pwnage juice") can be concocted with a Craft (Alchemy) check (DC 25), requiring a period of one day and alchemical materials costing 100 gp. The alchemical materials are ruined in the process. If this substance is drunk, the drinker receives the benefits of the Kool-Aid Man's sugar rush ability for one hour. Afterwards, she immediately becomes fatigued (and often irritable) until she rests properly. The substance is worth roughly 1500 gp on the open market.

The Kool-Aid Man regenerates the Kool-Aid in his body automatically as long as he is alive. If destroyed, only the remaining volume of Kool-Aid in his body can be harvested.

The Shobijin are a species of tiny feyfolk that come in twins. A pair of Shobijin act as heralds and priestesses of the great insect kaiju Mothra. They are kind souls to those who are kind in return, but warn those who defile the planet of the oncoming wrath of the mighty queen Mothra. While these fairies of Infant Island might not be strong, they make up for that lack in sheer dexterity and mental power. You might be able to attempt to swat Shobijin like flies, but you'll intensely regret it when their often sung-about Mosura arrives...
Shobijin: CR 1/8; Diminutive fey; HD 1/4d6; hp 1; Mas 7; Init +9 (+5 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 20 ft.; Defense 19, touch 19, flat-footed 14 (+4 size, +5 Dex); BAB 0; Grap -17; Atk -1 melee (1-5, slam); Full atk -1 melee (1-5, slam); FS 1 ft. by 1 ft.; Reach 0 ft.; SQ Low-light vision, psionics, Mosura Ya; AL Mothra, good; SV Fort -2, Ref +7.

Feats: Improved Initiative.
Mosura Ya (Sp): As a full-round action, the Shobijin may begin a chant to an egg of Mothra. As long as the chanting song remains undisturbed for 6 rounds, the egg immediately cracks into two Mothra larvae.
Psionics (Sp): At will-Lesser mindlink, sensitivity to psychic impressions, lesser dimension door (as dimension door, but may only move itself and the other Shobijin).

By Roku, here is the new Race write-up for the Coordinators:

Ability Modifiers: +2 STR, +4 Dex, +2 Con

Base Speed: 30ft

Resist Disease: Coordinators are resistant to most types of natural diseases, except for those that are alien in nature or engineered to target the Coordinators. They are also similarly resistant to poisons and radiation poisioning. Coordinators gain +4 to Fortitude saves against disease, poison, and radiation.

Incredible Reflexes: Coordinators are much more dextrous and quick-thinking than naturals. This alacrity provides them with a +2 dodge bonus to AC which applies even when fighting in a Mecha (but not in a starship).

Quick Mind: Coordinators can perform Computer Use and Research Checks faster than Naturals, as their minds process and absorb the information faster. The time required for any Computer Use or Research Check for a Coordinator is reduced by 50% (Minimum 1 full round). For Computer Use checks to find a file or break security, the time is instead reduced to a maximum of 1 minute.


SEED Mode: The Coordinator was born with a rare gene, allowing him to go into a state of almost perfect clarity. Once per day, for 1 round/level (Not ECL), The Coordinator may act as if hasted, as well as gaining a +4 insight bonus to attack rolls, saves, and Defense. If he doesn't make at least one attack roll or move towards an enemy every round, the SEED deactivates.

Choosing SEED Mode increases the ECL of a Coordinator by +1, to a total ECL+4.

Polis Massan
Excellent doctors and archaeologists, Polis Massans are almost always found on Polis Massa. Some Earth doctors have visited Polis Massa to learn from the master medics of the planet. The Polis Massans are a cetacean species that has no verbal language to speak of (no pun intended) but have a sign language form and mild telepathy. Polis Massans can learn other languages, but cannot speak them, only understand them.

Size: Small.
Ability Modifiers: -4 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Int, +2 Wis.
Speed: 20 feet.
Psionics: At will-lesser mindlink.
Skills: Due to their background, Polis Massans gain a +2 bonus to Craft (Pharmaceutical), Knowledge (History, physical sciences), and Treat Injury checks.

Kaleesh
Ferocious warriors from the Star Wars planet Kalee, the Kaleesh are honed in the art of combat. After the CLULESS event some of them were stranded in the rainforests of the islands near Costa Rica. When their Kalee brethren found them, they were surprised to find some wearing masks, not from the mumuu like the native Kalee Kaleesh, made from the skulls of some of Isla Sorna's mighty predators such as spinosaurus and the genetically-altered and enlarged velociraptors. Other than the Costa Rican colonies, few Kaleesh visit Earth, preferring to stay in their own little corner of the galaxy. Kaleesh are often considered handsome by other species under their intimidating masks (being pretty good intimidation even without them anyway) and are said to be similar in facial appearance to the Falleen.
Species Traits
Type: Monstrous humanoid.
Size: Medium.
Ability Modifiers: +2 Dex, -2 Wis, +2 Cha.
Speed: 30 feet.
Thermovision: Kaleesh have thermoreceptors that can be an aid to them in darkness. Any creature that gives off average heat or higher (see thermal targeting in d20 Future Tech) within 60 feet can be seen by a Kaleesh in all light conditions.
Species Enmity: The Kaleesh have an intense hatred of the Yam'rii, an insectoid alien species typically known as the Huk. They gain a +2 bonus to all attack rolls against Huk.
Free Languages: Read/Write and Speak Kaleesh and one language (usually English).
LA: +0.
New Item: Kaleesh Huntsman's Mask
This mask is designed from the skull of some ferocious beast killed by the wearer and is almost always worn by him or her. A Kaleesh huntsman's mask gives the wearer a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks. You can't buy a huntsman's mask in any legal circles since they are made by the hunter after his victory. For this reason and the fact that the only other real way would be to kill the maker and take the mask, Kaleesh will usually go for the throat of any non-Kaleesh wearing a huntsman's mask.

Pau'an
The larger of the pair of native species, the Pau'ans are the administrative and governmental half of the two. Some Pau'un features and habits, such as their sharp teeth and taste for raw meat, can be a bit unnerving at first. However, they aren't a particularly fierce people, usually welcoming outsiders. Some Pau'ans can be found in desert cities on Earth such as Cairo, most likely after travelling there for business purposes.
Species Traits
Size: Medium.
Ability Modifiers: -2 Str, +2 Wis.
Speed: 30 feet.
Stomach Integrity: Due to their raw meat diet, the Pau'ans have strong stomachs and are good at fighting off infections and poisons. They gain a +2 bonus to Fortitude saves.

Mustafarian
The Mustafarians are native to the fiery planet Mustafar, famous for being the site of the turning point in the history of the Star Wars universe. Two subspecies exist, the tall and thin Northern Mustafarians and the short, stocky Southern Mustafarians. Both Mustafarian breeds haven't left their planet and entered the Star Wars galaxy, much less our solar system, but don't have much peace with the more dedicated and able Star Wars buffs visiting their planet to take in the scenery of the Episode III battle between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Some criminals have found themselves baffled when their blasters or laser weapons are stopped by the Mustafarian's fire-resistant shells.
Species Traits
Size: Medium.
Ability Modifiers: Northern- -2 Str, +2 Con, +2 Dex. Southern- +2 Str, +2 Con, -2 Dex.
Speed: 20 feet.
Fire and Energy Resistance 10: The Mustafarians' exoskeletons give them a resistance of 10 to fire and energy damage.

Tintinna
Also known as Tin-Tin Dwarves, the Tintinna are a little rodent species possibly related to the ferocious Ranats. They can move quite fast in spite of their short legs. Despite their animalian appearance, Tintinna are amazing at utilizing technology when around it. If seen offworld, a Tintinna will usually be in the company of a smuggler, traders, starship pilot, or mechanic that decided to let the little alien have a ride. Some just drop them off while others will take them as pets or, if they realize their sentience, partners. Tintinna can now be found making colonies in the sewers and back alleys of several cities.

New Monsters
Recreations of classic kaiju, the new monsters (or neo-monsters, as some prefer to call them) are more modern versions of the fictional slowpokes and taildraggers. Along with the unchanged creatures of the modern Godzilla TV series (including the American Zilla), these monsters may be either a threat to mankind or a blessing...depending on how smart, how good, and how hungry they are.
GM's Note: Kaiju can be extremely powerful, and may be difficult to battle in most campaigns. If kaiju are to powerful for any mechs or equipment you throw at them, just ignore them.

Example New Monster: Neo-Titanosaurus
The original Titanosaurus was slow and somewhat unimpressive. The new beast is a fast, ferocious spinosaurid with a territorial streak. It mostly hangs out around the coastal waters of Indonesia, but sometimes takes extended journeys to Japan to feed upon giant squid.

Species Traits
Unlike other creatures of the Vermin type, Gyyagin has grown wicked and (for a Worm) cunning in his ancient, endless life, and has an Int score.
Weakness: Book-Bound: Gyyagin is bound to eternal slumber unless called forth from De Vermis Mysteriis. When called forth, Gyyagin appears on the initiative count one after his summoner’s. When killed, he retreats back into the book and cannot be called forth until his maximum hit points worth of sacrifices has been made to the book.
Destroying De Vermis Mysteriis causes Gyyagin to lose 1d4 Con per round until he reaches 0 Con and dies.

I don't think I made him big enough, but colossal just seems stupidly big...maybe it's because I play medium-sized characters...
If anyone cares to improve upon it feel free

NEW RACE:


Think he's not a BakeNeko? Just wait 'till he grins at ya...

BAKENEKO


In Coreline, the term 'BakeNeko' is used for two different types of Fictions: actual humanoid cat-spirits who have entered the 'mortal realm' (but are different from, say, Geobreeder-verse Phantom Cats) and Fictions that were designed with extreme cat-like features (but aren't QUITE fully animalistic). Statistically, they are the same.
BakeNeko have an attitude and occasional mannerisms that are 'cat-like' (duh), and any number of cat-like features, such as ears, fangs, eyes and claws. They rarely see a need to disguise themselves.

RACIAL TRAITS:
*+2 Dexterity.
*30 ft. Base Speed.
*Jumpers: BakeNekos add 20 feet to their Jump check results (still have to roll normally, though).
*Low-Light Vision: The BakeNeko can see twice as far as normal in low-light conditions. The BakeNeko can still distinguish colors.
*Cat-Like Special Movement: BakeNekos take half damage (rounded down) from most falling and always land on their feet.
*Natural Weapons (Claws and Fangs): BakeNekos have highly developed fangs and sharp nails, which might not be lethal, but can be painful.
The claws give an additional 1d4 (Slashing) to melee attacks, while the fangs inflict (normal character melee damage +2, Piercing) damage.
A BakeNako who bites can maintain a biting grip, inflicting equivalent damage each round. These additional attacks are automatically succesful, but the opponent can break the hold with a succesful Strength check.
The BakeNeko cannot use weapons to defend himself while using the hold, and has a -4 penalty to evade any attack as well.

Messengers a crows or ravens that give a new meaning to the grouping term "murder". Messengers will follow and violently attack a murderer without remorse, only really attacking others if they get in the way. When a Messenger flock has fulfilled its duty, the birds will either leave for more justice bringing or stay and watch over the land.

Well, they would definately be living constructs in the opposite sense of the demonic autos. Also, I realized that, just like the MSRD, a Coreline "SRD" of PDFs would be incomplete, because of certain non-OGL content like Apocalypse and Future Tech. Speaking of Apocalypse, I've been thinking on turning poor Papua New Guinea into a mutant wasteland as per Toho's Prophecies of Nostradamus. Now for something new. Sadly, my advanced class creation juices have gone away, and I can't seem to craft the Priestess and Alchemist.

Possessions: Club, robes, 1d4 gold coins.
Shapeshifting (Su): The Tanuki may use the spell Polymorph at will. There are some minor differences. First, it may only polymorph itself. It may only become Animal, Humanoid, Magical Beast, or Monstrous Humanoid. The Tanuki may also appear to be inanimate objects. May only become creatures in the Tiny to Large size category.

Illusions (Su): The Tanuki may cast spells from the Illusion school as though it were an 8th level Sorcerer (from d20 Past, 8th level Mage may be substituted for OGL purposes). Favored tricks include turning leaves into money, and horse manure into delicious food.

Converted Feat: Persuasive
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Bluff checks and Intimidate checks.

TRANSFORMERS


'Transformers' is the street name given in Coreline to the living robots from Cybertron. Valiant Autobots, Destructive Decepticons, and the occasional 'innocent bystander' (if one can call 'em THAT) Cybertronian, most have come to Earth looking for a new life.

They are as diverse as the regular human, and one thing is certain: they truly are more than meets the eye.

RACIAL STATS:

Size: Transformers can range in size from Small to Colossal, though they are generally in the Large to Gargantuan range. Their ability adjustments and base land speed are based on size.

Ability Adjustments:
Small: Str -4, Dex +8, Con +2,
Medium: Dex +4, Con +2,
Large: Str +4, Dex -2, Con +4
Huge: Str +8, Dex -4, Con +4
Gargantuan: Str +12, Dex -6, Con +6
Colossal: Str +16, Dex -8, Con +6

Speed:
Small: 20ft
Medium: 30ft
Large: 40ft
Huge: 50ft
Gargantuan: 60ft
Colossal: 70ft

Type: Construct (Living construct)
As living Machines Transformers combine aspects of both constructs and living creatures, as detailed below.

    * A living construct derives its Hit Dice, base attack bonus progression, saving throws, and skill points from the class it selects.
    * Unlike other constructs, a living construct has a Constitution score. A living construct does not gain bonus hit points by size but gains (or loses) bonus hit points through a Constitution bonus (or penalty) as with other living creatures.
    * Unlike other constructs, a living construct does not have darkvision. Unlike other living constructs, a Cybertronian does have low-light vision.
    * Unlike other constructs, a living construct is not immune to mind-influencing effects.
    * Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, disease, nausea, fatigue, exhaustion, and energy drain.
    * A living construct cannot heal damage naturally.
    * Unlike other constructs, living constructs are subject to critical hits, effects requiring a Fort save, death from massive damage, nonlethal damage, stunning, ability damage, ability drain, and death effects or necromancy effects.
    * Unlike other constructs, a living construct can use the run action.
    * Living constructs can be affected by spells that target living creatures as well as by those that target constructs. Damage dealt to a living construct can be healed by a cure light wounds spell or a repair light damage spell, for example, and a living construct is vulnerable to a harm spell. However, spells from the healing subschool provide only half effect to a living construct.
    * A living construct responds slightly differently from other living creatures when reduced to 0 hit points. A living construct with 0 hit points is disabled, just like a living creature. He can only take a single move action or standard action in each round, but strenuous activity does not risk further injury. When his hit points are less than 0 and greater than -10, a living construct is inert. He is unconscious and helpless, and he cannot perform any actions. However, an inert living construct does not lose additional hit points unless more damage is dealt to him, as with a living creature that is stable.
    * Can be raised or resurrected.
    * Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, but can still benefit from the effects of consumable spells and magic items such as heroes' feast and potions.
    * Does not need to sleep, but must rest for 8 hours before preparing spells.
    * Cybertronians can be repaired using the Repair skill. A successful Repair check (DC 30) heals 1d10 points of damage, and each check represents 1 hour of work. A Cybertronian may make the repair check on themselves.


Spark: Transformers have been imbued with life by the AllSpark. This gives them, in effect, a 'soul' or spirit. They can master powers of Arcane, Divine, or Psionic origin just as easily as any other life form.

Transformation: Transformers have an innate ability to transform into some vehicle-based form. This is a purely mechanical transformation, and parts required for its vehicle form are visible in its normal bipedal form.

As a standard action, a Transformer may assume into its chosen form or back again. While transformed, they lose any attacks that require appendages (although they may keep any ranged weapons that are mounted on weapons mounts).

At first level a Transformer chooses a civilian vehicle of the same size category as it’s base form. A Transformer becomes a standard version of the vehicle, but may later add gear (such as mounted weapons.) Whenever a Transformer would gain a new feat due to hit die, it may also change it’s vehicle form, so long as the new vehicle is of the same size category as it’s base form.

While in vehicle form they use all of the stats of the chosen vehicle form with the following exceptions: The Transformer keeps it’s own hit points, class defense bonus to armor class, and treats the listed vehicle’s hardness as Damage Reduction /-. A Transformer also retains any benefit from it’s feats or class talents (such as a fast hero’s increased speed or a tough hero’s damage reduction.)

While in vehicle form the Transformer follows all rules for vehicle movement, maneuvers, and stunts. The Transformer is treated as it’s own driver, but may relinquish (or regain) control to a passenger in the driver’s position as a free action once per round.

Skill Bonuses: All Transformers gain a +5 species bonus to Drive and Pilot as well as a +2 bonus to Disguise and Bluff. A Transformer is naturally capable of maneuvering it’s self and is can easily disguise it’s self as a mundane vehicle.

Free Language Skills: Read/Write Cybertronian, Read/Write English.

Other Languages: Any

Temperature Damage: Transformers are vulnerable to temperature extremes. They obtain double damage from cold and hot-based attacks that reach -30 degrees and 500+ degrees, respectively (more accurately, liquid nitrogen and thermite).

Level Adjustment: By size.
Small & Medium: +2
Large: +3
Huge: +4
Gargantuan: +5
Colossal: +6
