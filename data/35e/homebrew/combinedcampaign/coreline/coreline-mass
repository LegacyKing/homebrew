Project: Hellsoldier' is the product of this resolution.


Created by a joint consortium on the laboratories of Dr. Sylia Stingray on the corporate section of Asgard, 'Project:Hellsoldier' is one of the latest programs designed to create a super-soldier, except that this one, rather that aiming to direct enhancing of the physical abilities of a subject (although this is one of the procedure's effects), is aimed to make him capable of fighting aganist magic-and psionic-slinging foes. Augmented with enhanced regenerative abilities, psionic and magic resistance (and a way to turn this aganist their foes), the 'Hellsoldiers' are fully capable of facing off aganist one of these enemies, and surviving long enough to dispose of them thru conventional means.

Even with the 'ultra-violent military' name, 'Project: Hellsoldier' has, so far, only seen limited uses on agents of the Offices.

Template: 'Project: Hellsoldier'
It can be added to any humanoid creature (refered to hereafter as the character). It uses the character's statistics and special abilities in addition to those descibed below.
Challenge Rating: Same as the Character +3.
Hit Dice: Same as the character.
Speed: Same as the character +5 feet.
Defense: The character gains a +2 natual armor bonus.

-Fast Healing 4: The character heals 4 points of damage each round so long as he has at least 1 point.
-Magic Resistance 10: As the ability of the same name.
-Power Resistance 10: As the ability of the same name.
-Transfer Resistance (Su): As a standard action, the Hellsoldier can add one point of their spell/power resistance per round of concentration to an object or a willing creature. Unwilling creatures get a Will save (DC 15) to resist.
-'Why Won't You DIE!?!' (Ex): The character is not killed until he reaches -20 hit points rather then -10. If a character has less than -9 hit points for a period of greater than a minute (10 rounds) however his hit points immediately drop to -20.

-Saves: Same as the character, with a +3 bonus on Will and Dex saves.

Here it is, my idea of the Reffing Champion. For now, well, it lacks pretty much everything such as class progression, Bonus Feats, and I think I could add a few more reffing-related class abilities.

Well, in any case, I can do nothing more but give you...


THE REFFING CHAMPION




‘Reffing', ‘Riffing', ‘Lifting', all (slightly) different terms to one recently-appearing (by Coreline time) Fiction sport: to grab a hoverboard and ‘surf' the wild blue yonder. While many people practice it, the Reffing Champion stands head and shoulders above the rest. He has a connection with the crowds, with the sky and his board, and applies them all into creating the wildest art possible, etching it in the sky with the hoverboard's plasma jet.
‘Reffing Champions' are always looking for the next big challenge, that one stunt that will make them be remembered for a long time. Sometimes they adventure with other people to make ends meet, or because they think that the party might just be that ‘big challenge'.

If they're lucky, they'll make the cover of ray=out. If not… then they'll go down in a blaze of glory (and other miscellaneous injuries).

Select this class if you want your character to be one of those crazy few that put Reffing above everything else.
The fastest path into this advanced class is thru the Fast hero class.

REQUIREMENTS:
-Skills: Balance 5 ranks, Tumble 8 Ranks.
-Feats: Improved Initiative.

CLASS SKILLS:
The Reffing Champion's skills are: Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Jump (Str), Knowledge (Pop Culture) (Int), Knowledge (Current Events) (Int), Repair (Int), Spot (Wis) and Tumble (Dex).

Skill Points at each level: 6 + Int Modifier.

CLASS FEATURES:

CHAMPION: By honing his body and mind to be the ultimate Reffer, the Reffing Champion gains a natural affinity with all hoverboards and can attempt maneuvers with them that defy belief. The Reffing Champion may always add half his class level (up to +5) to any Tumble checks.

BONUS FEATS: (have to work on that).

POWER DIVE: The Power Dive is a well-known maneuver amongst Reffing fanatics, though few ever truly master it. By gunning the throttle and sending his hoverboard into a shallow dive, the Reffing Champion may add 50 mph to the top speed of any hoverboard he is on. The Power Dive may never be attempted at a height of less than 60 ft. and may not be performed in consecutive rounds.

SIGNATURE MOVE: At th Level, the Reffing Champion develops a Signature Move, a spectacular stunt performed at high speed. Signature Moves often gain the name of the Reffing Champion who invented them and are instantly attempted by every Reffer throughout the planet. A Reffing Champion is required to make a Tumble check at DC 25 in order to successfully perform his Signature Move, but if he does so in front of an audience of at least 10 people, he gains a +5 morale bonus to any one skill check, attack roll or saving throw made within the next minute.


So, pretty please... HELP!

Oz, the Land Down Under
After the 23 hours, Australia recieved a menagerie of species from various places. As said earlier, a colony of Quadrillians lives in the northern reaches, but the Outback is ruled by several kinds of sentient bipedal animals. A Whole group of cities run by these creatures appeared out of the bleak desert, and for reasons unknown the rusted hulk of a mechA landed near Uluru.
New Species: Tassie Tiger
While the thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian tiger) of Coreline was extinct, a sentient species lives on in the dusty towns of the Outback. Most Tassie Tigers fall into two categories-cityfolk or rural vigilantes. These creatures are experts with boomerangs and the vigilantes often carry a pair wherever they go. Tassie Tigers prefer to act on impulse rather than think things out.
Tassie Tiger Species Traits
Size: Small. Tassie Tigers gain a +1 size bonus to Defense, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. They suffer a –4 size penalty on grapple checks. Tassie Tigers must use smaller weapons than humans use, and their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.
Ability Modifiers: +2 Dex, -2 Wisdom.
Low-Light Vision: Tassie Tigers can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
'Rang Expertise: Tassie Tigers gain the feat Exotic Weapons Proficiency (Boomerang) for free. When using a boomerang, a Tassie Tiger deals one extra hit dice.
Free Language Skills: Read/Write and Speak English.

(Homebrew stats for boomerang go here.)

Giving credit where credit is due, I borrowed Cyber-Dave's Medium Mecha rules for this particular design (after all, if you're going to design a beanpole that you can only see with a microscope...)


E.D.W.A.R.D. Mecha (Left) and conceptual design for its counterpart (tech name unknown, but it would have to fit A.L.P.H.O.N.S.E.)

Mishima Heavy Industries Experimental Deployment Weapon-Advanced Response Device (E.D.W.A.R.D.).

An experimental power armor, the ‘Ed' was designed to provide operators with means to attack rapidly and up close and personal, with varying degrees of lethality. Its main military deployment method is as a ‘tunnel rat' and anti-riot armor mecha. Currently, the Faction that uses the E.D.W.A.R.D. the most are the Resembool Rangers.

The E.D.W.A.R.D. installed with the standard equipment package (see below) has a Purchase DC of

Size: Medium (+0 Size).
Superstructure: Duralloy.
Armor: Duralloy.
Armor Penalty: -8.
Strength Bonus: +4.
Speed: 20 ft.
Bonus Hit Points: 50.
Hardness: 15.
Bonus to Defense: +8.
Fighting Space: 5 Ft. by 5 Ft.
Reach: 5 ft.
Dexterity Penalty: -.
Base Purchase DC: 36.

Standard Equipment Package: Pilot's Cockpit (Helmet and Torso), PS-15 Panther Claws (Left Arm-Homerule: this version also deals Piercing damage), Thunderbolt Shock Rod (Right Arm), Class 2 Sensor System (Shoulders), LX-10 Antishock Array (Boots).

###############
Feat
###############

ALPHA STRIKE.
You let them have it. With ALL barrels.

PreRequisites: Mecha Weapons Proficiency, Attack Bonus of 3+.
Benefits: The Alpha Strike ability is enabled with an Action Point (used at the beginning of the character's turn). After that, if the character goes for the full attack option, he can unleash all of the mecha's weapons on one target (and just one. Distance, AoO rules and any collateral damage still apply, as well).

###############
Mecha Stuff
##############
NEW MECHA GEAR

E7-MW ‘LFO' MECHA KNIFE.
High-tech, mecha-sized knives, sharpened to a near-monofilament edge, balanced and designed as boomerangs. Because of this, the knives have a high chance of returning if thrown at a target, and can cut thru most kinds of mecha armor like butter. These knives are the standard-issue weapons of the Light Finding Operation-class mecha.

They can be deployed or retracted in their sheaths as a free action.

While held, the knives convert the mecha's slam attack into a claw attack that deals slashing damage. The amount of damage is based on the mecha's size: Large 6d8, Huge 8d8, Gargantuan 10d8, and Colossal 12d8. The claws have a critical threat range of 19–20.
The claws are one size category smaller than the mecha's size category.

If thrown, the E7-MW Knife has a range increment of 60 ft., and deals damage equal to its normal claw attack (equal Critical range, too). As well, the thrower must make a Reflex save, DC 15, to catch the knife as it returns. Failure means one of three things (GM's call):

1) The thrower gets hit in the face by his own returning weapon. He can attempt avoid being struck by making a Reflex save against DC 10.

2) The Knife lands 1d4 squares away from his position in a random direction (and might probably hit someone standing there-they can makea Reflex save as well).

3) The Knife lands in a randomly determined square adjacent to him.

Equipment Slots: 1, must be hand (or arm if Large).
Activation: Attack action.
Range: Touch.
Target: Single target within reach or 600 ft. (if thrown).
Duration: Instantaneous.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 12 + one-quarter the mecha's base purchase DC.
Restriction: None.

‘HOT ROD' WHEEL FEET.
The feet of the mecha have retractable wheels with independent motors. Although while deployed, they make the mecha look like an in-line skater, and they do not have the durability of tank threads, the ‘Hot Rod' wheels trade this by giving the mecha unparallel land speed.
A mecha equipped with ‘Hot Rod' Wheel Feet has its base land speed increased by 15 feet.

Equipment Slots: 2, must be boots.
Activation: Free action.
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 8 + one-quarter the mecha's base purchase DC.
Restriction: None.

One other piece that I thought of:

ANCHORING BOLTS.
A set of bolts deploy explosively from the soles of the mecha's feet, anchoring it to the ground. Originally installed to provide stability while firing heavy weapons, the Anchoring Bolts have become standard to mecha designs that require constant secure footing (artic exploration/combat and starship defense mechas, for example).
The Anchoring Bolts, when deployed, provide the mecha with a +8 bonus on all checks involving stability, such as resisting bull rush attempts and trip attacks. However, the mecha cannot move while they're deployed (and will most surely damage whatever it's standing on if it tries to).
If used in melee combat, the Anchoring Bolts create 1d4 damage, and can ignore 10 points of hardness (but the awkwardness of using them in this fashion reflects in a -2 penalty to the attack roll).

Equipment Slots: 2, must be boots.
Activation: Free action.
Range: Personal.
Target: You.
Duration: Persistent.
Saving Throw: None.
Purchase DC: 8 + one-quarter the mecha's base purchase DC.
Restriction: None.

And finally, because my friends wanted me to add 'Rahxephon' to this setting:

SAW (Sonic Assault Weapon) MODEL 27 (‘The Song').
A highly experimental weapon that was recently developed, the SAW is aimed towards two fronts: riot control and standard combat, and it deals with this by means of focused sonics. For this, the SAW-27 has two firing modes: the ‘Soprano' mode, which fires an omnidirectional sonic wave that is meant to stun anything living (and able to listen) that is standing around the mecha, and the ‘Aria' mode, which fires a concentrated line of sound towards one single target-resulting in a powerful concussive wave.

The SAW-27 is a package deal consisting of two items: a sonic generator and a combination resonance chamber/projector. The reason the weapon has obtained its nick-name (‘The Song') is because, although the generator itself (the bulkiest part of the package) can be installed anywhere within the mecha, most manufacturers have made a (somewhat unconscious) decision to install the resonance chamber in the mecha's head, usually covered with an armor plate that slides out of the way when active-giving the impression of the mecha ‘opening its mouth'.

In Coreline, the SAW-27 is produced solely by Diggers Technologies (with help given in the resonance chamber design by Georgia Tech), although other companies have started to develop other, less powerful variants. Urban legend surrounding the design of ‘The Song' (especially its unusual position in the mecha's body) mentions such things as being (extremely) reverse-engineered Mulian technology (the ‘27' in the designation standing for the year of their home ‘verse, 2027).

Rules-wise, the SAW-27 in ‘Soprano' mode affects a circle of twice the mecha's reach (meaning that if a mecha has 10 ft. reach, the circle if of 20 ft. starting from the mecha). All targets inside the circle must make a Fort save, DC 18, or be stunned for 1d6 rounds (critical failure will make them be Nauseated for the same amount). Targets with proper ear protection can have a bonus to this save or negate the effects altogether.

The SAW-27 in ‘Aria' mode deals 12d6 of Concussion damage with a successful ranged attack (critical range 20), and additionally any targets hit must make a Fort save, DC 20, or be deafened for 1d4 rounds after being hit (critical failure will have them Stunned as well for the same amount of time). Targets with proper ear protection can have a bonus to this save or negate it altogether.

Equipment Slots: 2, one of which must be Helmet.
Activation: Attack action.
Range Increment/Range: 120 feet (focused beam), or twice the mecha's reach (‘Soprano' mode).
Target: Single target within 12, 000 feet, or (mecha's reach x2) circle.
Duration: Instantaneous/Persistent.
Saving Throw: None or Fort (see text).
Purchase DC: 25.
Restriction: Military (+3).

############

NEW FEAT: Photographic Memory.
You have perfect recall of everything you've experienced.
PreRequisite: Int 15+.
Benefit: You can recall everything you've seen, read ir experienced perfectly. If you forget some detail your character should remember, you can ask the GM to remind you. You get a +2 bonus on any skill rolls for which rote memorization is useful (at the GM's judgment).

NEW CLASS:

PREACHER

What a Preacher is, in Coreline, switches between cults. Some of them are conmen of some kind, some of them have heard a higher calling, and depending on the cult a Preacher might be one more powerless cog in the machine or a large-caliber leader.
What they all have in common is that they combine a prompt use of vocabulary, pouring on the charisma and fingering to rouse the masses into doing what's necessary at the time.
Select this class if you want your character to present an aura of righteousness and rouse the masses into whatever fits his whims.

The earliest a character can enter the Preacher advanced class is via the Dedicated hero basic class.

Requirements
To qualify as a Preacher, a character must fulfill the following criteria.
Skills: Knowledge (theology and philosophy) 6 ranks, Sense Motive 6 ranks.
Feat: Trustworthy.
Special: An allegiance to a specific religious faith.

Class Information
Hit Die: 1d6 + Con modifier.
Action Points: 6 + ½ character level, rounded down, every time the character attains a new level in this class.
Class Skills: The Preacher's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are: Concentrate (Con), Craft (visual art, writing) (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (arcane lore, behavioral sciences, civics, current events, history, popular culture, theology and philosophy) (Int), Perform (act, sing, stand-up) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Read/Write Language (none), Research (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Speak Language (none), Treat Injury (Wis).
Skill Points at Each Level: 7 + Int modifier.

Table: The Preacher
Level-- BAB-- Fort-- Ref-- Will-- Features-- Defence-- Reputation
1st-- +0-- +1-- +1-- +2-- Sermon-- +0-- +1
2nd-- +1-- +2-- +2-- +3-- Righteous fury-- +1-- +1
3rd-- +1-- +2-- +2-- +3-- Bonus feat-- +1-- +1
4th-- +2-- +2-- +2-- +4-- Talk down (one target)-- +1-- +2
5th-- +2-- +3-- +3-- +4-- Divine favour-- +2-- +2
6th-- +3-- +3-- +3-- +5-- Bonus feat-- +2-- +2
7th-- +3-- +4-- +4-- +5-- Talk down (multiple targets)-- +2-- +3
8th-- +4-- +4-- +4-- +6-- Motivate the flock-- +3-- +3
9th-- +4-- +4-- +4-- +6-- Bonus feat-- +3-- +3
10th-- +5-- +5-- +5-- +7-- Talk down (all targets)-- +3-- +4

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Preacher advanced class.

Sermon
A Preacher holds great influence with those of the same allegiance. Beginning at 1st level, a Preacher gains a +4 bonus on all Charisma-based skill checks when dealing with members of his allegiance.

Righteous Fury
A 2nd level Preacher may launch into a Righteous Fury, where divine or spiritual inspiration lends him strength. For a number of rounds equal to the Preacher's class level, he may use his Charisma or Wisdom modifier (whichever is higher) instead of his Strength modifier when making melee attacks, ability checks, or skill checks. The Preacher may use the Righteous Fury ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum of once).

Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Preacher gains a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Preacher must meet all of the prerequisites of the feat to select it.
Attentive, Combat Expertise, Creative, Defensive Martial Arts, Educated, Heroic Surge, Horse Trading, Improved Disarm, Iron Will, Medical Expert, Renown, Studious.

Talk Down
A Preacher of 4th level or higher can talk his way out of trouble. Either prior to the start of hostilities or during combat, the character can talk down a single opponent within 30 feet of his position. The target must be able to understand the Preacher. That opponent immediately stops fighting and reverts to an indifferent attitude regarding the Preacher and the situation in general. Any hostile action directed at the opponent by the Preacher or by an ally of the Preacher allows the opponent to act as he sees fit.
To initiate this talent, the Preacher must spend a full-round action talking to his opponent. The opponent must make a Will save (DC 10 + Preacher's class level + Preacher's Charisma modifier). If the save fails, the opponent stops fighting. If the save succeeds, the opponent continues as normal.
At 7th level, a Preacher can talk down a number of opponents equal to 1 + his Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The opponents must still be within 30 feet of his position.
At 10th level, the range extends to 60 feet and covers all opponents who can hear and understand the Preacher's voice.

Divine Favor
Starting at 5th level, whenever a Preacher spends 1 action point to improve the result of a die roll, he rolls one more action die than his level would normally allow. The Preacher selects the highest die roll to add to his d20 roll.

Motivate the Flock
Through an inspirational prayer, the Preacher can urge the faithful to great deeds. If an 8th level Preacher spends one minute speaking and exhorting fellow members of his allegiance, all of those members within 60 feet of the Preacher gain a +2 morale bonus to all skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to the Preacher's class level. In order to receive this bonus, a character must be able to both see and hear the Preacher during the entire minute of his motivational speech. The Preacher may use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier with a minimum of once per day.

NEW RACE:

GAINAXVERSE ATLANTEANS (adapted from Ronin Arts' ‘Occult Heroes').






This particular version of the Altlanteans is the one seen in the Gainax series ‘Secret of Blue Water'. Although the sole examples of this race are two of the series' main characters (which were not the best examples), and the rest of the race itself has been believed extinct since the late 1800s, multiple fanfic authors have thought otherwise.
When the Vanishing happened, the CLULESS Virus had full access to their thoughts and their notes, to their desires to see this race (or, at least, this vision of the race) to still be alive.
And so, it happened. Several civilian cruise ships that were out on the ocean at the time reported the landing of humongous red ships that then turned into ‘moving islands' (even though no military, Fiction or otherwise, could confirm these sightings). Some time after that, semi-mechanical PsiCrystals started to appear in the open market from a number of small Mediterranean companies.

And sometime after that, an organization calling itself ‘Neo Atlantis' started to wreak havoc on the areas of Africa that weren't part of the Pan-African Nation, mostly those on the coastlines.

The rest of the race denies their connections to this organization wholeheartedly (especially since, in their opinion, the organization is full of ‘black sheep'), but those NeoAtlans out there think just like the NeoAtlans of the series did, in that the Human race is nothing but slaves to the Atlanteans, and they must be conquered.

A Gainaxverse Atlantean is no different appearance-wise from a normal human, even though they look Mediterranean, with deep tanned skin, dark hair (of blues or blacks) and brown, black or jade eyes. Their main difference is their psionic aptitude, which enables them to control their bodies greatly (every Gainaxverse Atlantean is taught how to do this from childhood, even if they receive no further psionic training).

Personality-wise, Gainaxverse Atlanteans are self-confident and slightly aloof. Those Gainaxverse Atlanteans that are ‘evil' see mankind as ‘sub-human', while those who are ‘good', while pleasant to stay around, can still present a paternalistic attitude. Both sides treasure knowledge and the power of the mind greatly.

Gainaxverse Atlanteans have colonies in South and Central America and in the North Atlantic.

RACIAL STATISTICS:

Type: Humanoid.
Size: Medium.
Ability Modifiers: -2 Charisma.
Base Speed: 30 ft.
Naturally Psionic: Gainaxverse Atlanteans gain 2 bonus power points at 1st Level. This benefit does not grant them the ability to manifest powers unless they gain that ability through another source, such as levels in a psionic class.
Resistance (Su): Gainaxverse Atlanteans can use psionic energy to increase their resistance to various forms of attack. A Gainaxverse Atlantean can spend 1 power point to gain a +4 racial bonus on saving throws until the beginning of her next action. This Supernatural ability can be used at any time-even on another creature's turn.
Resilience (Su): When a Gainaxverse Atlantean takes damage, she can spend power points to reduce its severity. She can reduce the damage she is about to take by 2 hit points for every 1 power point she spends. This Supernatural ability can be used at any time-even on another creature's turn.
Repletion (Su): A Gainaxverse Atlantean can sustain her body without need of food or water. If she spends 1 power point, a Gainaxverse Atlantean does not need to eat or drink for 24 hours.
Level Adjustment: +0.

???, the spring of drowned Twins
falling in this spring causes a character to split into two identical people in all ways. In the event that the character who falls in is cursed prior to this with a different curse, the character permanently splits into seperate individuals each taking one form of the curse. For example, if Ranma were to fall in the spring of drowned twins after falling the spring of drowned girl, Ranma would split into a male version of himself and a female version of himself (who would also be very angry).

YAUJTA




Their species is called the ‘Yaujta' (in their language meaning the ‘survivors'), but almost all the other species know them by other name: the ‘Predators'. This race of humanoid reptilians has grown into becoming one of the nastiest hunters out there. For them, honor and the Hunter's Code is everything. For hundreds of years, they saw all other species out there as prey-and Humans, with their increasing use of balancing technology and ever-present ability to adapt to survive, were one of their most coveted prizes.
On Coreline, the situation quickly became something different. They were one of many Fiction races to appear, and although a good deal of them went on a rampage at the view of such exotic prizes, others decided to hang back and scout the scene. Those who went on rampages were quickly eliminated by prey that they underestimated, and the humongous number of Yaujta that died during the 23 Hours (not to mention the number of destroyed neighborhoods that came from some of them doing the ‘spoil-sport' thing) made it understandable to the Yaujta society: if the Hunt was to continue on Coreline, it would be necessary to understand all new Prey, and more important, what advantages the common Prey now had. And so, they laid low.
Cue some time later. The Yaujta integrated into society, and although the Spirit of the Hunt and its Code is one thing that will never truly fade away, some of them had found that living just for it was an extremely quick way to gain bad rep, enemies (and possibly getting fragged) in this world. Those Yaujta that make a honest living do so as bounty hunters, trackers, guides and even park rangers. Those who don't are hired muscle, assassins and plain psycho killers.

RACIAL TRAITS:
*+4 Str, +2 Con, -2 Int, -4 Cha.
*Large-Sized Monstrous Humanoids.
*Base Speed of 30 feet. The Yaujta's speed is not reduced by brush, foliage or broken terrain.
*+2 Natural Defense Bonus: Yaujta have tough, leathery skin.
*Unusual Vision: The Yaujta can see in only one spectrum of light: infra-red. While it's a superior spectral range, this vision, however, has poor resolution. A Yaujta effectively has Darkvision, and can ignore all concealment penalties, but they have a -2 species penalty to Spot checks. This penalty increases to -4 if the object in question is not moving
*Energy Resistance 5 to Fire, Electrical, Acid and Radiation damage.
*Cold Sensitive: Yaujta take an additional 2 points of subdual damage per die of cold damage they suffer. If a save allows the cold damage to be reduced, the same reduction applies to this additional damage.
*+1 species bonus to Climb checks and Strength, for purposes of how much can the Yaujta lift or carry. This bonus raises by 1 every four levels.
*Free Languages: Yaujta.
*Level Adjustment: +3.

The above design still has space for options. Specifically 2 open spaces in the Shoulders and 2 in the Legs. Some options:

-Missile/Rocket System in the Shoulders
-Another Speed Boost in the Legs
