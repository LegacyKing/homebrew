'KNOWLEDGE (Fiction): This represents the Things Man Created For His Entertainment And Now Are Here To Get Even. In this case, anything that was once trivia MIGHT now be a true lifesaver.
Check: you can recall or access knowledge pertaining to the knowledge of Fiction facts, particularly details about species, locations, vehicles, spells, personalities and other ‘miscellaneous trivia facts’. You have insight or speculations about Fiction-related phenomena, and field knowledge of how certain Fictions attack and what makes them tick.
Special: You cannot gain ranks in Knowledge (Fiction) thru the spending of skill points. You can only gain it thru the reading of Fiction-related materials (such as journals, articles and ‘specials’) and through encounters with Fictions. This is always considered a cross-class skill, and can only be taken by Coreline Humans.
Furthermore, the more ranks a Post-Vanishing Human obtains in Knowledge (Fiction), the higher the penalty on other skills, such as Handle Magic Device and Psionic skills (except Autohypnosis).'

Like I said, has to be ironed for bugs (any help is kindy appreciated), but the idea was that it would be like the 'Cthulhu Mythos' Skill from CoC D20, only that it would be what we (right now) know as 'trivia'. Like the Mythos Skill, it comes with a price-that being that the more you know of the Fictions, the more you're locked on 'reality', and thus, magic (beneficial or otherwise) stops affecting you.
