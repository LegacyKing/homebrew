Homing Weapon (Melee only)
"Magic Sword, appear! ...Or something."
With this quality, a magic weapon that has been thrown can be called by reciting a special command phrase. While this phrase is a free action, it takes a standard action for the sword to actually enter your hand. Any creature in a direct path from the sword to you that is considered by you to be an enemy is dealt the typical damage of the weapon plus damage as if the weapon has feel 100 feet. A Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Charisma modifier) halves the damage.
Purchase DC: +2.

Actually, the Snarfquest D20 RPG (Got my copy signed by Larry elmore at origins  ) has Bikini Armor. You get your charisma bonus to your AC in addition to Dex and the armors bonus (same as Chain Shirt)





A new "cybernetic attachment" (used in the least literal sense here) in reflection of my steampunk post in the Gazette.
Automail

This heavy metal can be used to make a prosthetic. Any prosthetic made with automail gains +3 Hardness, +2 hit points, and any damage dealt by unarmed strikes with the automail increase by one rank (example: 1d6 damage going up to 1d8, etc.) On the drawbacks side, anyone with automail has a -4 penalty to Swim checks, and the purchase DC is increased by 2.

I feel that I have been silent for far too long.
Heroic Children
While the d20 Modern Core Rulebook states that a character gains their first class levels after passing the age of 12, the same is not true for plenty of Fictions. These new rules are an attempt to bring heroic children into the game.

    * Normal heroic children cannot have physical stats higher than 15.
    * They have the ability score modifiers listed in the Core Rulebook.
    * Student and Rural are viable occupations for classed children, as well as any homebrew creations designated.
    * Children are considered size Small, unlike older humans.
    * Heroic children cannot be higher than 5th level until they reach 12.


Duelists
From the Yu-Gi-Oh!verse, Duelists use cards to battle against each other. Despite some flashy hologram work, monsters themselves do not have stats, and the flow of battle is designated by move and attack actions. In other words, it really isn't much different from playing the real card game. However, playing a hologram duel is slightly more edgy and taxing on the Duelist's body. For every 100 life points lost in the battle, the Duelist is dealt 1d6 points of nonlethal damage.

EDIT: Basilisks moved.
