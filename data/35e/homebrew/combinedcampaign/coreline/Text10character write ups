Here's the Jack Sparrow write-up I've been using in my own adventures:

Captain Jack Sparrow
"Savvy?"

“Atention, ladies and gentlemen. This will only take but a minute of your time. If you could kindly take off your watches, wallets and other objects of value… and if you, yes, you sir, could kindly go to the galley and bring all the rum to this room…”

In Coreline, Jack Sparrow is a clash. He is from the far past, but his general attitude is very modern. He’s a Fiction, but he lacks the rather… extreme qualities that other famous Fiction pirates have. He’s a conman where other Fiction pirates are scrappers, and is trying to consider himself as a sort of gentleman thief-a thing that his common ‘Keith Richards from the 1600’s’ attitude has made hard to sell.
As well, while his crew is now using high technology, he’s made it quite clear that not one nail of the Black Pearl is to be touched.

Where it concerns the state of the world at large, he’d made it clear that he wants nothing to do with, specially if it concerns anything supernatural (“never had much luck concerning that, me and me ship”). But if profit (especially profit that won’t come back and bite him) is to be obtained, he’ll be the first guy to go for it, be it transporting cargo (most probably of the illicit kind), guiding people in (and out) of the Caribbean or his ever-beloved piracy and treasure-hunting.

An unknown fact among Caribbean inhabitants (or, at least, not spoken aloud) is that Jack Sparrow and other alternates of him have made a pact, a gentleman’s challenge of sorts: that the one Jack Sparrow that pulled off the most daring ‘gentleman thievery’ act of them all (or, at the least, obtained the most loot from doing them) would be proclaimed as the True Captain Jack Sparrow. This is, of course, a thing that all Captain Jack Sparrows of the Caribbean want.

* Its the only thing that makes any sense quite frankly.

The Black Pearl (**)
A former East India Trading Company vessel called 'the Wicked Wench', and his first command, Sparrow loves this vessel a lot. It would take an extreme act of supernatural nature to make him so much as think in abandoning it-and even then, he'd do anything to get her back.

Crew 30; Passengers 15, Cargo 20,000 lb.; Init -2; Maneuv. +14; Top Spd. 40 (4); Def 12; Hardness 10; HP 80; Size Collossal; Purchase DC 35.

** These stats assume that Captain Jack Sparrow is piloting the Black Pearl otherwise her Init is -6, and Manevu. -5 (+2 Init. and +3 Maneuv. due to the construction of the ship, -8 size).

The Compass: This compass was given to him (or he stole it from) Tia Dalma. The Compass is (at first glance) quirky, since it doesn't points north. It does, however, points to the person's 'most wanted thing' (In Jack's case, loot and whatnot) with some degree of accuracy (for example, it doesn't gives any idea of how far it is, and acts 'broken' if in the immediate area).
If the person doesn't knows what he 'wants most', the Compass is completely useless (unless the person makes a Will roll, DC 20. Then the Compass will be 'clear' of what the person 'wants most' and point).

Will, I think, would have a couple of levels in Swashbuckler, and Barbossa would have at least one level of Tough traded in [if based on Jacks write-up].
