CORELINE HUMANS:
They're "meats", "terrans", "monkey-boys", whatever. They're like you: two arms, two legs, opposing thumbs. Look at yourself in the mirror if you still need more. They were here before the Vanishing, they were here after the Vanishing, and they'll be out there forever.
What you don't know is that some MIGHT have a liiiiiitttle thing in difference.
RACIAL TRAITS:
-Post-Vanishing Human:
*As per the rulebook, additional +1 to Wealth.

-Pre-Vanishing Human:
*As per rulebook, with these exceptions:
* Uses next higher die for rolling starting hit points (1d4>1d6>1d8>1d10>1d12)
* Has an additional +4 to any saving throws to any magic attacks. Has a -4 penalty to use any magic.

FICTIONS

(Colonial) Remnant Humans:


They come from the universes of “Battlestar Galactica”. They are the last of the once-proud 12 Colonies of Kobol, on the run and on the search of the fabled 13th Colony- the shining blue planet we call “Earth”. It was written on their scriptures that it was a sort of paradise, and after the destruction of their homeworlds, it's their only hope left.
They are here, and they discovered quite quickly that this was anything but a freakin' paradise. They have no place else to go, and so, must adapt.
All of a sudden, the threat of the Cylons is the LEAST of their problems.
Racial Traits:
Remnant Humans are as per the rulebook, with these exceptions:
*They hate Cylons A LOT: +1 (or +2) to any attack roll involving robots (this adds up to any other thing, like the "Down With Robots" ability of the D20F Technosavant). Role-playing-wise, they're very paranoid around robots and A.I.s.
*"If we let them escape, they'll become stronger and come back for revenge. It's in their nature.": A Remnant Human obtains a +1 to any rolls involving rallying Remnant Humans. Charismatic heroes are due to squeeze the life out of this one.
*"Yes, we're tired. Yes, there's no relief. Yes, the Cylons keep coming after us time, after time, after time-and yes, we're still expected to DO OUR JOBS!":The Remnant Human has a +2 bonus to rolls to avoid exhaustion due to lack of sleep, or sleep-creating effects. Some of them are chronic insomniacs.
*"Hurry up, people! We have only 32 minutes left!": Choosing to climb up the difficulty one step, a Remnant Human can do any kind of repair roll or jury-rigging in half the time (minimum of 30 minutes). If something cannot be battle-ready in 30 minutes or less, they're prone to ditch it.


-Kryyn (aka Kryn):


The Kryn are a race of anthropomorphs. They are feline-looking in appearance, although they have long-ago "outgrown" some of their most "animal" characteristics. Their only settlement on Earth is a long-ago -crashed cityship in Peru, which has evolved the fable of El Dorado. They have little contact with the exterior.
Racial Traits:
*+2 Dex, -2 Wis: Kryn are very stealthy and have a good sense of balance. Recluded upbringing, however, makes them somewhat naive considering Earth stuff.
*Medium-sized.
*Base speed of 30 Feet.
*+2 racial bonus on Listen, Climb and Run Silent checks: Necessity to avoid humans has giver Kryn a reason to try and be undetected.

Half Giant
*+2 Strength, +2 Constitution, -2 Dexterity: Half-giants are tough and strong, but not too nimble.
*Giant: Half-giants are not subject to spells or effects that affect only humanoids, such as charm person or dominate person.
*Medium: As Medium creatures, half-giants have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
*Half-giant base land speed is 30 feet.
*Low-Light Vision: A half-giant can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
*Powerful Build: The physical stature of half-giants lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Whenever a half-giant is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject's size category.
*Level Adjustment: +1. (maybe. What do you think?)


-Micronized Zentraedi and general traits:
*Medium-Sized Humanoids.
*Speed of 30 ft.
*+2 Strength or Dexterity, +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma: they have been brought up as warriors for countless generations, and so, it's pretty hard to them to show a soft side.
*Newly-appeared Zentraedi may not select Charismatic Hero or Charismatic Ordinary as their first class: again, warrior upbringing. Their concept of ‘charisma' mostly comes down to being on the right side of a weapon when making an order.
After a time of exposure (roughly three or four months), Zentraedi have enough of a grasp on the concept of ‘charisma' to ‘give it a shot'. The GM might then let the Zentraedi cross-class into the Charismatic Hero or Charismatic Ordinary classes, but not before.
*All Zentraedi must select either the Emergency Services, Military, or Technician occupations. And again, their upbringing. For them, it's just the battlefield and how to survive on it.
*Newly-appeared Zentraedi suffer a -2 penalty to all Bluff, Disguise, Forgery, Gather Information, Knowledge (art, behavioral sciences, business, current events, earth and life sciences, physical sciences, popular culture, streetwise, theology and philosophy), Perform, and Sense Motive checks.
After a time of exposure (roughly three or four months), they might have become acclimated to Earth culture, and these penalties may be reduced to -1 or eliminated altogether at the GM's discretion.
*Zentraedi suffer a permanent -2 penalty to all Craft and Repair checks.

Full-size Zentraedi use the above stats, with the following modifications:
*Size changes to Gargantuan (apply size penalties as appropriate).
*Speed of 50 ft.
*+24 Strength, +12 Constitution (as well as a corresponding increase in hit points).
*-4 Dexterity.
*Damage reduction: 10/--.
*Level Adjustment: +3.



From "Fallout":
DEATHCLAWS:


These huge, bipedal monsters were derived and created from chameleons. They were created by an unknown faction as shock troops, but for some reason (one can only assume the Vanishing), they were never used and set free. They are subdivided in two main factions with a few offshoots, and so far, are mostly found in North America, although a very few have wandered into other lands, like Central America, Russia and Canada. Deathclaws are one of the fastest and strongest creatures you will find around the Americas.
These stats are based on their main two factions.
-Eastern Deathclaws: They are located on small encampments all over the East Coast up to Maine. They are more human-like in some ways that their Western cousins, bigger and stronger, although they're not quite as smart, they have founded a cohesive culture.
They stand between 12 and 14 feet tall, with claws a foot long or more.
*+6 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Con, -2 Int, -4 Cha.
*Large-Sized: As Large-sized creatures, Eastern Deathclaws have a -1 AC penalty for their size, but gain a +15 natural AC. They can wear no armor, and can wield no weapons other than their natural weapons.
*Damage Reduction 10/-
*Darkvision 60 feet
*Deathclaw base speed is 60 feet.
*Natural Weapons: Claws: 4d8, Bite: 3d8. A Deathclaw adds his Str bonus to this damage. Deathclaws cannot wield any weapons, but can take any weapon-enhancing feats/class features for their natural weapons.
*Improved Grab: If a Deathclaw hits with both claw attacks, it may latch on to an enemy and make bite attacks with an additional bonus of +4. The held creature takes 2d8 points of damage from the claws every round.
*Ram: Deathclaws may charge an enemy and deal 4d6+10 damage with their horns without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the enemy is two or more sizes smaller than the Deathclaw, it may also trample for 3d6 damage.
*Frightening Appearance: Deathclaws receive a +10 circumstance bonus to Intimidate rolls against non-Deathclaws of the same size or smaller.
*Level Adjustment: +5

*Western Deathclaws: Stationed on small villages all over the Americal Southwest and the West Coast out to Alaska, the Western Deathclaws are actually smaller, faster and smarter than their Eastern cousins, and some have managed to make a place for themselves on places like Las Vegas and Denver, hiring out their services as bodyguards, bouncers, or strong-arms.
They stand between 8 and 10 feet tall, with 6 to 10-inch-long claws.
Stats-wise, they are the same as the Eastern Deathclaws, except for the following:
*Large-Sized: As Large-sized creatures, Western Deathclaws have a -1 AC penalty for their size, but gain a +10 natural AC. They can wear no armor, and can wield no weapons other than their natural weapons, or weapons that augment their natural weapons.
*Damage Reduction: 6/-.

“GHOULS”:


One thing is for sure: not everybody who is exposed to radiation gets off lucky. These people didn't got off, even if they DID survived. “Ghouls” had their DNA was mutated to an unknown extent by the nuclear and biological WMDs of their home dimension, making their lifespan extremely long. The mutation, unfortunately, was not without a price. For all extents and purposes, the “ghouls” look like the undead. Their skin peels off and festers, sores and tumors cover their desiccated bodies, and they shuffle slowly. For all this, the mutation and their own expanded lifespans have made them fearfully intelligent and keen-sensed.
“Ghouls” are the shunned of the Earth, and they accept this fact. They have formed ghettoes and towns for their own, and if they need to go out, they make a point of covering fully. They will NEVER go to London if they can help it (or else Hellsing might get 'em just on principle). Living year after year in a nearly-dead body has made more than one resentful, and so will hold their trust from normal people until it is earned.
They are divided into two factions: the “normal” Ghouls, and the less-numbered “Glowing Ones”.
-“Normal” Ghouls: This is your “standard” Ghoul. They are not strong physically, but are dreadfully sharp in many cases. They tend to go for less stressful positions, such as doctors, advisors, techs or merchants.
TRAITS:
*+2 Wis, +2 Int, -2 Con, -2 Str.
*Medium-Sized.
*Speed 20 ft.
*+1 to Spot and Search checks.
*Rad-Resistant: Ghouls gain a +5 to any rolls involving radiation resistance, completely ignore the damage on a successful save, and halve said damage on a failed save.

Ghoul Rad Resistant	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	DESC:Ghouls gain a +5 to any rolls involving radiation resistance, completely ignore the damage on a successful save, and halve said damage on a failed save.

-“Glowing Ones”: A few poor unfortunate Ghouls were so close to the WMD blasts that they were “infected” with residual radiation that will stay for years to come. They are called “Glowing Ones” because at night they glow very dimly from the residual radiation. They are just like normal Ghouls, except they're a little less intelligent and can create radiation poisoning by their touch. The Glowing Ones are very dim, prone to wild mood swings, and the awareness that they can't get close to normal creatures without making them harm makes them feel desperately lonely.
They are just like normal Ghouls, except for these adjustments:
*+2 Wis, -2 Str, -2 Cha.
*Medium-Sized.
*Speed 20 ft.
*Radioactive: Glowing Ones emit Low radiation within a 5-foot radius of himself. Upon striking a target unarmed, a Glowing One emits a burst of radiation of Moderate strength. (see Radiation Sickness rules in D20F). They usually buy anti-radiation suits to wear around normal people.
-Level Adjustment: +2.

#ENTERED
THUNDERIAN


The Royal Guard & Lord Lion-O, ready to rock.

This race comes from an Animate Fiction universe, most probably one from some 80's series (which would explain their ‘goody-two-shoes' personalities). Their home planet was destroyed in a cataclysmic explosion, and they have wandered all over the place looking for a new home. At the time of the Vanishing, apparently, they have received a beacon signal from their Royal Guard, guiding them to said new home (funny thing, they say, that it's where their home planet used to be), when they appeared in orbit over Coreline.
They have established themselves all over Coreline on places that resemble their planet, which include Africa, Asia and the jungles of Central America. Their society is based on a code of honor that enforces trust, peacefulness, loyalty and fighting evil whenever it is found. Although peaceful by nature (and strangely lacking in enemies), they can get to be very vicious when fighting a foe, like the felines they resemble (and evolved from).
They are a race of anthropomorphic felines, and as such, there's often jokes made at their backs that they might be distant relatives of the Kryn.

RACIAL TRAITS:
*Medium Humanoids.
*Base speed is 30 feet.
*+2 Strength & Dexterity, -2 Wisdom. Thunderians are very strong & dexterous but they tend to be overly curious & prone to trouble.
*Improved Low-light Vision:Thunderians can see four times as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, & similar conditions of poor illumination. They retains the ability to distinguish color & detail under these conditions.
*+2 Spot & Listen checks. A Thunderian has naturally keen senses.
*+2 Climb & Jump & Move silently checks. Thunderian's retractable claws aid in climbing & they are naturally stealthy & athletic like the great cats they are descended from.
*+2 to Survival checks. Thunderians are naturally at home in the wilderness.
*Scent ability. Thunderians have a highly sensitive sense of smell.
*Natural attacks: 1d4 (x2). Thunderians have retractable claws on their hands & feet that aid in climbing & they are often used in combat.
*Thundrilium Vulnerability: Thunderians are assumed to be one step higher when rolling for effects of Radiation Sickness on exposure to Thundrillium (see D20 Future, pg. 81).
Although this is an extremely rare element (and it didn't even existed Pre-Vanishing on Coreline), several Thunderian devices are powered by it, and its gold by-product has become the seed for a slight (but damaging) gold rush.
*Effective Level: +1.
(NOTE: Although the write-up is fully based on the ‘Thundercats' series, it is my belief that the abilities shown by the series Thundercats (who are the Royal Guard, BTW) are both the result of training and (limtedly) mutation, or at least that's how it shows on one of the Wildstorm comics.
Consider this a 'base' Thunderian racial stat).


APES:


Hailing from a parallel dimension that had monkeys develop advanced cognitive capabilities on par with humans' (and then declaring us their pets), the apes are pretty much a reflection of us-that is, if we were (or still were) like them. They use guns. They have cities. They have a government.
They just don't like us “damn, dirty humans”.
For all means and purposes, there are only two playable classes of ape: the Chimpanzee, which is the most “normal” of the two, and the Gorilla, who is used more normally as a “heavy trooper”.
-Chimpanzees:
*+2 Dex, -2 Int.
*Medium-Sized.
*They start with the Alertness feat
*They have the Scent ability.
*Bite attack of 1d6+1 damage.
*Speed of 30 ft (40 when moving on all fours). Climb speed of 30 ft.

-Gorillas:
*+4 Str, -2 Int, Wis and Cha.
*Large-Sized.
*They start with the Alertness feat.
*They have the Scent ability.
*Bite attack of 1d6+2, Claw attack (?) of 1d6+5.
*Speed of 25 ft (35 when moving on all fours). Climb speed of 30 ft.


Based on a D&D write-up by Damien Crowley (modified by me):


Races of the Galactic Empire in Coreline.

-JAWA: The small, hooded tinkerers of the setting can be easily found around the Zoid Zone, the Nevada/New Mexico desert and the Australian Outback, scavenging from destroyed mechas and shot-down ships. They have made a living as hi-tech gypsies and for-hire techies.
Racial Stats:
*Small-Sized Humanoids.
*Base Speed of 20 ft.
*+2 Dex, -4 Str, -2 Cha.
*Racial Feats: Jawas have the Planetary Adaptation (Hot World) and Salvage Feat for free.
*Free Languages: Speak/Read Jawa.

-Wookiee: Located on the Washington, Colombian and Amazon jungles and forests, they have made a living as guides and (when they decide to live in the city) bodyguards and ‘strong-arms'.
Racial Stats.
*Type: Humanoid (wookiee)
*Medium-size.
*+4 Strength, -2 Dexterity, -2 Charisma.
*Speed: 30 feet.
*Climbing Claws: Wookiees gain a +4 Climb bonus and deal lethal damage unarmed.
*Wookiee Rage (Ex): Wookiees can enter a near-mindless rage granting them a +4 bonus to Strength, +2 hit points per level, and a +2 bonus to Fortitude and Will saves at the expense of caution, imposing a -2 penalty to Defense. See page 33 of the Star Wars RPG for details.
*Skill Bonuses: Wookiees carry a reputation for short fuses and violent tempers, granting them a +4 bonus to Intimidate checks.
*Free Languages: Speak and Read/write Shyriiwook. Wookiees' vocal cords prevent them from creating the syllables necessary to speak any other languages that don't have a ‘growl' base.

New Racial Feat: Common Speaker. (Wookie, First-Level Only).
Effect: The Wookie's vocal cords have developed enough to speak languages other than Shyriiwook, but unfortunately, while they can understand it fully, they cannot speak it on their own.
Normal: A Wookie cannot speak languages other than Shyriiwook, and if they decide to learn others, they must contain the same ‘base language' (meaning growls, howls and other animal noises).

Zabrak: While they have obtained a bad rep during the 23 Hours, since there was a large number of Alternates of Darth Maul running around, they have since gained a rep as reliable employees, where their dedication is highly considered.
*Type: Humanoid (zabrak).
*Medium-size.
*Speed: 30 feet.
*Saves: +2 to Fortitude and Willpower saves.
*Bonus Feat: Zabrak gain one bonus feat at first level.
*Free Languages: Speak and Read/Write Zabrak.

Gungans: Located in swampy areas like the Everglades and Louisiana, they have obtained a reputation as guides and trackers. The fact that they have had ‘a lousy presence in the new movies' has made one and all of them quite driven to build that.
*Type: Humanoid (gungan).
*Medium-size.
*+2 Constitution, -2 Wisdom.
*Speed: 30 feet; 20 feet (swim).
*Low-Light Vision (Ex): Gungans can see twice as far as normal in poor lighting conditions. Gungans can still distinguish colors, even in dim lighting.
*Hold Breath (Ex): Gungans can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to 25 times their Constitution score before needing to make checks against drowning.
*Saves: Gungans gain a +2 species bonus on Reflex saves.
*Free Languages: Speak and Read/Write Gungan.

Bothans: The lot of them that have appeared in Coreline immediately went on and joined together into a full-blown information network. Once the Corporations and other Fictions tried to wipe out said network repeatedly, they went off-world. Now, they have probably one of the best niches in the Black Market in the LaGrange and Sol System Colonies.
*Type: Humanoid (bothan).
*Medium-size.
*+2 Charisma, -2 Constitution.
*Speed: 30 feet.
*Information Network: Bothans have an extensive information network of spies and information brokers. A bothan may requisition information just as they would equipment. You make a special level check (1d20 + your character level + your Charisma modifier) against a DC equal to what the information's Knowledge check DC would be. Apply your Reuptation bonus to this check as a bonus if the bothan community sees you favorably, or a penalty if they see you unfavorably.
*Skills: Bothans gain a +2 species bonus to Gather Information and Investigate checks. Bothans also gain +4 skill points at 1st level, and 1 extra skill point at each additional level.
*Free Languages: Speak and Reak/Write Bothese.

Twi'leks: The ‘Tail-Heads' have expanded themselves to hot places where they can avoid trouble, and possibly obtain some benefits-places like Las Vegas, the Zoid Zone, and the Martian Colonies. They have built a reputation as concierges.
*Type: Humanoid (twi'lek).
*Medium-size.
*+2 Charisma, -2 Strength.
*Base Speed: 30 feet.
*Low-Light Vision (Ex): Twi'leks can see twice as far as normal in poor lighting conditions. Twi'leks can still distinguish colors, even in dim lighting.
*Racial Saves: Twi'leks gain a +2 species bonus to Fortitude saves to resist poisons or toxins.
*Racial Skills: Twi'leks gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Perform checks.
*Bonus Feat: Twi'leks gain a bonus feat at 1st level.
*Free Languages: Speak and Read/Write Ryl.


(The following write-ups were made w/a lot of trial-and-error-sorry, just started to watch. Appreciate any help w/this).
GALLIFREY:

Planet Gallifrey, the home of the Time Lords, is (or depending on who exactly you ask, WAS) a staple of the TV series ‘Doctor Who'. The planet's inhabitants were, back in their home dimension, the masters of time and space, capable of traveling the whole of it the same way a common human would go the closest store. They had lots of knowledge-and the law to not interfere with other races' histories. It was wiped out recently, by an event called, quite appropriately, the ‘Time War'.
But CLULESS had other ideas. As well as well-known characters of the series (friend and for alike) appeared on Coreline, the planet proper appeared on the very edge of the Sol System, past Pluto, inside a time-space bubble that had made it all but undetectable to scans from Earth. While this distortion has made them impossible to detect by conventional means, they found out during the 23 Hours (thru contact with those Time Lords and Alternated that were on Coreline) that their own worst nightmare has come to pass: there were lots –LOTS- of individuals with access to time-travel technology, and the cold-bloodedness to travel back and change history to their own whims. Fortunately (or UNfortunately, it seems) there is no way to go back to any time before the 23 Hours that holds CLULESS proper-all attempts have only managed to reach alternate universes located in Earth's past.
Even so, the Gallifreyians decided –with a lot of aplomb by ‘renegade' members- to throw their laws of non-interference out the window. With such a potential for damage out there, remaining so would do nothing but harm to themselves.
And so, there's representatives of the planet on the UNSC and select agencies on Coreline, not all of them Time Lords, but all of them having at least some knowledge of temporal mechanics.

Gallifreyans: Born in Gallifrey (although the term is more of a misnomer since they are ‘woven' by a genetic Loom), they have generations of genetic engineering on their blood. Lots of them have first appeared in Coreline during the 23 Hours as an effect of CLULESS wondering what the hell happened. Not all of them are very disposed to be adventurers, since their upbringing was much academic, but even then, they make great advisors.
Racial Traits:
*Medium Humanoids (Gallifreyians).
*Ability Modifiers: +2 Wis, +2 Int.
*Base Speed: 30 Feet.
*Racial Skills: All Gallifreyans consider Knowledge (Temporal Sciences) to be a class skill.
*Gallifreyans come with a standard package of genetic enhancements which include:

Fast Healing (Ex) 1: A Gallifreyan heals 1 point of damage each round so long as he has at least 1 hit point.

Low–Light Vision (Ex): A Gallifreyan has low-light vision and can see objects twice as far away as a basic human. The effective radius of bright light or shadowy illumination is doubled.

Respiratory Bypass (Ex): A Gallifreyan can close down his respiratory system for a number of rounds equal to his Constitution x 3. This can be used to hold the effects of smoke and gas at bay.

Scent (Ex): This ability allows the Gallifreyan to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes and track by sense of smell.

Weakness to Gas Attacks: If a Gallifreyan fails to activate his Respiratory Bypass their enhanced sense of smell causes them to take a –4 penalty on Fortitude Saves to resist gas attacks. Corrosive gases inflict double damage.

In addition, Gallifreyans that become Time Lords receive:

Lindal Gland (Ex): A biological implant which triggers the process of regeneration when a Gallifreyan's hit points fall below 0. This process can be activated a maximum of 12 times.

Telepathy (Su): Any Gallifreyan with an Intelligence of 6 or higher can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

*Free Language: Gallifreyan, an odd combination between mathematical symbols and (apparent) Greek symbols, used in extremely long sequences per word.
*Level Adjustment: +3.

REGENERATION RULES: Regeneration is automatically triggered when a Time Lord's hit points fall to -10 or lower, or when a Massive Damage Save is failed, or in any circumstance in which the Time Lord's body dies. The body must exist for Regeneration to take place- if the body is disintegrated, for example, Regeneration is not possible.

The process of Regeneration recreates the character's physical body and usually generates a new personality. When a character undergoes Regeneration, generate a new set of scores for Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. You may choose to determine a new personality for the character. The character looses all permanent Doubt points in the process of Regeneration. The character's level, hit points, skills, feats and all other characteristics remain the same.

The character wakes from Regeneration after 1D6 hours with their full hit point total, but Shaken. The Shaken condition lasts for 1D6 hours. Additionally, dying tends to be quite traumatic and the character must make a Will saving throw (DC 15 + number of previous Regenerations) or suffer the effects of a Disorder, determined randomly from the following table.

Regeneration Disorders
Disorder Result on D20
Amnesia 1-8
Depression 9-12
Obsession 13-16
Paranoia 17-20

Duration of Regeneration Disorder
Will Save failed by Duration
1-5 1d10 minutes
6-9 1d10 hours
10+ 1d10 days

(GM'S NOTE): On Issues of Balance: The ability to Renew Time Lords obviously apart from other characters. Regeneration is a significant asset for a character, but in practice it does not raise issues of balance. Regeneration effectively marks the end of one character and the beginning of another. The post-Regeneration Time Lord could even be played by a different person. In this way, the game effect of Regeneration is ultimately the same as a character dying and then being replaced by an entirely new character.

NEW SKILL: Knowledge (Temporal Sciences) (INT) Trained Only
This category of Knowledge encompasses all the complex theories and knowledge related to manipulating, using, and traveling through time and space.


The following two races are (to my own belief) powerful, but maybe my changes balanced them a little. I am a little biased aganist adding this series to the setting, but my friends are big-deal fans of this, and did everything short of pointing a gun to my head to make me post them.



A New Species (thanks to Michael Tresca).
HUMAN-XENOMORPH HYBRID ('Bug-Juiced').

The Xenomorphs. There is one Fiction species out there that has never been renamed, and for due reason. They are so deadly, that renaming them would be useless. On their home universes, there's been many attempts to clone them, control them, or use them as weapons in any way.
One of such ways has been human experimentation, creating hybrids that would be (theoretically) smart, strong, destructive and loyal. Of course, this is *theoretically*.
The hybrids are driven by primitive instinct (standard Xenomorph behavior: protect Queen and Hive, find resources for the Hive to expand), which more often than not are *way* too disconcerting to be used in the field alongside other humans (and even some Fiction species find them just as unsettling). That they can ‘feel' Xenomorphs and are registered as ‘do not attack' on the Xeno's senses helps even less.
On Coreline, they are a tight bunch. The ‘Earth Hive', they call themselves, after an Aliens comic. Their desire is to be left alone.
Of course, that is because if angered, the part of them that is a Xeno might strike back.

Racial Stats:
*+2 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Con, -2 Wis, -2 Cha.
*Medium-Size.
*Base Speed: 30 Ft.
*-2 to Diplomacy rolls: Xenomorphic instincts don't give much in talkative desires.
*Acid Blood: Whenever a physical attack hurts a Hybrid, there is a chance for acid blood to do ‘splash damage'. The DC for the Reflex save (anyone within 5 feet of the Hybrid) is equal to the damage made (divide by ½ if it's a bludgeoning or piercing weapon). Damage from acid damage is 1d6 per 6 points made (round down), to a maximum of 10d6. Any item exposed to the spray must make a save vs. the DC of the amount of damage made (Mastercraft items get a +5 to the save). Failure destroys the item.
*Unusual Physiology: Attempts to use Treat Injury on the Hybrid have a -4 penalty (unless they have the Xenomedic Feat). In addition, all items used must be custom-made to withstand the acidic blood.
*Fast Healing: Hybrids have Fast Healing 1.
*Xeno-Sense: Whenever a Hybrid is within a mile of a Xenomorph, they may make a Wisdom check (DC 35-1 per Xenomorph within that range). If this succeeds, the Hybrid is aware of its presence, but gain no extra details of its location beyond a generic direction and range (‘It's that way, near/far').
*Ignored Target: A Xenomorph will ignore a Hybrid until the Hybrid attacks it.
*Impregnation Immunity: Hybrids cannot be infested by Xenomorphs.
*Level Adjustment: +3.

YAUJTA




Their species is called the ‘Yaujta' (in their language meaning the ‘survivors'), but almost all the other species know them by other name: the ‘Predators'. This race of humanoid reptilians has grown into becoming one of the nastiest hunters out there. For them, honor and the Hunter's Code is everything. For hundreds of years, they saw all other species out there as prey-and Humans, with their increasing use of balancing technology and ever-present ability to adapt to survive, were one of their most coveted prizes.
On Coreline, the situation quickly became something different. They were one of many Fiction races to appear, and although a good deal of them went on a rampage at the view of such exotic prizes, others decided to hang back and scout the scene. Those who went on rampages were quickly eliminated by prey that they underestimated, and the humongous number of Yaujta that died during the 23 Hours (not to mention the number of destroyed neighborhoods that came from some of them doing the ‘spoil-sport' thing) made it understandable to the Yaujta society: if the Hunt was to continue on Coreline, it would be necessary to understand all new Prey, and more important, what advantages the common Prey now had. And so, they laid low.
Cue some time later. The Yaujta integrated into society, and although the Spirit of the Hunt and its Code is one thing that will never truly fade away, some of them had found that living just for it was an extremely quick way to gain bad rep, enemies (and possibly getting fragged) in this world. Those Yaujta that make a honest living do so as bounty hunters, trackers, guides and even park rangers. Those who don't are hired muscle, assassins and plain psycho killers.

RACIAL TRAITS:
*+4 Str, +2 Con, -2 Int, -4 Cha.
*Large-Sized Monstrous Humanoids.
*Base Speed of 30 feet. The Yaujta's speed is not reduced by brush, foliage or broken terrain.
*+2 Natural Defense Bonus: Yaujta have tough, leathery skin.
*Unusual Vision: The Yaujta can see in only one spectrum of light: infra-red. While it's a superior spectral range, this vision, however, has poor resolution. A Yaujta effectively has Darkvision, and can ignore all concealment penalties, but they have a -2 species penalty to Spot checks. This penalty increases to -4 if the object in question is not moving
*Energy Resistance 5 to Fire, Electrical, Acid and Radiation damage.
*Cold Sensitive: Yaujta take an additional 2 points of subdual damage per die of cold damage they suffer. If a save allows the cold damage to be reduced, the same reduction applies to this additional damage.
*+1 species bonus to Climb checks and Strength, for purposes of how much can the Yaujta lift or carry. This bonus raises by 1 every four levels.
*Free Languages: Yaujta.
*Level Adjustment: +3.

Polis Massan
Excellent doctors and archaeologists, Polis Massans are almost always found on Polis Massa. Some Earth doctors have visited Polis Massa to learn from the master medics of the planet.

Kaleesh
Ferocious warriors from the Star Wars planet Kalee, the Kaleesh are honed in the art of combat. After the CLULESS event some of them were stranded in the rainforests of the islands near Costa Rica. When their Kalee brethren found them, they were surprised to find some wearing masks, not from the mumuu like the native Kalee Kaleesh, made from the skulls of some of Isla Sorna's mighty predators such as spinosaurus and the genetically-altered and enlarged velociraptors. Other than the Costa Rican colonies, few Kaleesh visit Earth, preferring to stay in their own little corner of the galaxy. Kaleesh are often considered handsome by other species under their intimidating masks (being pretty good intimidation even without them anyway) and are said to be similar in facial appearance to the Falleen.
Species Traits
Type: Monstrous humanoid.
Size: Medium.
Ability Modifiers: +2 Dex, -2 Wis, +2 Cha.
Speed: 30 feet.
Thermovision: Kaleesh have thermoreceptors that can be an aid to them in darkness. Any creature that gives off average heat or higher (see thermal targeting in d20 Future Tech) within 60 feet can be seen by a Kaleesh in all light conditions.

Free Languages: Read/Write and Speak Kaleesh and one language (usually English).

New Item: Kaleesh Huntsman's Mask
This mask is designed from the skull of some ferocious beast killed by the wearer and is almost always worn by him or her. A Kaleesh huntsman's mask gives the wearer a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks. You can't buy a huntsman's mask in any legal circles since they are made by the hunter after his victory. For this reason and the fact that the only other real way would be to kill the maker and take the mask, Kaleesh will usually go for the throat of any non-Kaleesh wearing a huntsman's mask.

Pau'an
The larger of the pair of native species, the Pau'ans are the administrative and governmental half of the two. Some Pau'un features and habits, such as their sharp teeth and taste for raw meat, can be a bit unnerving at first. However, they aren't a particularly fierce people, usually welcoming outsiders. Some Pau'ans can be found in desert cities on Earth such as Cairo, most likely after travelling there for business purposes.
Species Traits

The Mustafarians are native to the fiery planet Mustafar, famous for being the site of the turning point in the history of the Star Wars universe. Two subspecies exist, the tall and thin Northern Mustafarians and the short, stocky Southern Mustafarians. Both Mustafarian breeds haven't left their planet and entered the Star Wars galaxy, much less our solar system, but don't have much peace with the more dedicated and able Star Wars buffs visiting their planet to take in the scenery of the Episode III battle between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Some criminals have found themselves baffled when their blasters or laser weapons are stopped by the Mustafarian's fire-resistant shells.

New Weapon: Mustafarian Longrifle
These weapons are designed to get past the exoskeletons of the Mustafarians since they resist the fiery sting of laser and blaster weapons.

You won't find many offplanet with the exceptions of stowaways and Badlander water cultists. Visitors are advised to keep their liquid resources hidden, because a lack of doing so might get your drinks stolen. It is also a good idea to not look like Han Solo.

Tintinna
Also known as Tin-Tin Dwarves, the Tintinna are a little rodent species possibly related to the ferocious Ranats. They can move quite fast in spite of their short legs. Despite their animalian appearance, Tintinna are amazing at utilizing technology when around it. If seen offworld, a Tintinna will usually be in the company of a smuggler, traders, starship pilot, or mechanic that decided to let the little alien have a ride. Some just drop them off while others will take them as pets or, if they realize their sentience, partners. Tintinna can now be found making colonies in the sewers and back alleys of several cities.

Yaka
The Yaka are another example of Arkanian engineering. Once primitives, the Yaka are now one of the most intelligent species in the galaxy.

In infancy, a Yaka is given cybernetic enhancements, meaning that every member of the species is, in a sense, a cyborg.
Species Traits
Size: Medium.
Ability Modifiers: +2 Str, +4 Int, -4 Cha.

TRANSFORMERS


'Transformers' is the street name given in Coreline to the living robots from Cybertron. Valiant Autobots, Destructive Decepticons, and the occasional 'innocent bystander' (if one can call 'em THAT) Cybertronian, most have come to Earth looking for a new life.

They are as diverse as the regular human, and one thing is certain: they truly are more than meets the eye.

RACIAL STATS:

Size: Transformers can range in size from Small to Colossal, though they are generally in the Large to Gargantuan range. Their ability adjustments and base land speed are based on size.

Ability Adjustments:
Small: Str -4, Dex +8, Con +2,
Medium: Dex +4, Con +2,
Large: Str +4, Dex -2, Con +4
Huge: Str +8, Dex -4, Con +4
Gargantuan: Str +12, Dex -6, Con +6
Colossal: Str +16, Dex -8, Con +6

Speed:
Small: 20ft
Medium: 30ft
Large: 40ft
Huge: 50ft
Gargantuan: 60ft
Colossal: 70ft

Type: Construct (Living construct)
As living Machines Transformers combine aspects of both constructs and living creatures, as detailed below.

    * A living construct derives its Hit Dice, base attack bonus progression, saving throws, and skill points from the class it selects.
    * Unlike other constructs, a living construct has a Constitution score. A living construct does not gain bonus hit points by size but gains (or loses) bonus hit points through a Constitution bonus (or penalty) as with other living creatures.
    * Unlike other constructs, a living construct does not have darkvision. Unlike other living constructs, a Cybertronian does have low-light vision.
    * Unlike other constructs, a living construct is not immune to mind-influencing effects.
    * Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, disease, nausea, fatigue, exhaustion, and energy drain.
    * A living construct cannot heal damage naturally.
    * Unlike other constructs, living constructs are subject to critical hits, effects requiring a Fort save, death from massive damage, nonlethal damage, stunning, ability damage, ability drain, and death effects or necromancy effects.
    * Unlike other constructs, a living construct can use the run action.
    * Living constructs can be affected by spells that target living creatures as well as by those that target constructs. Damage dealt to a living construct can be healed by a cure light wounds spell or a repair light damage spell, for example, and a living construct is vulnerable to a harm spell. However, spells from the healing subschool provide only half effect to a living construct.
    * A living construct responds slightly differently from other living creatures when reduced to 0 hit points. A living construct with 0 hit points is disabled, just like a living creature. He can only take a single move action or standard action in each round, but strenuous activity does not risk further injury. When his hit points are less than 0 and greater than -10, a living construct is inert. He is unconscious and helpless, and he cannot perform any actions. However, an inert living construct does not lose additional hit points unless more damage is dealt to him, as with a living creature that is stable.
    * Can be raised or resurrected.
    * Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, but can still benefit from the effects of consumable spells and magic items such as heroes' feast and potions.
    * Does not need to sleep, but must rest for 8 hours before preparing spells.
    * Cybertronians can be repaired using the Repair skill. A successful Repair check (DC 30) heals 1d10 points of damage, and each check represents 1 hour of work. A Cybertronian may make the repair check on themselves.


Spark: Transformers have been imbued with life by the AllSpark. This gives them, in effect, a 'soul' or spirit. They can master powers of Arcane, Divine, or Psionic origin just as easily as any other life form.

Transformation: Transformers have an innate ability to transform into some vehicle-based form. This is a purely mechanical transformation, and parts required for its vehicle form are visible in its normal bipedal form.

As a standard action, a Transformer may assume into its chosen form or back again. While transformed, they lose any attacks that require appendages (although they may keep any ranged weapons that are mounted on weapons mounts).

At first level a Transformer chooses a civilian vehicle of the same size category as it's base form. A Transformer becomes a standard version of the vehicle, but may later add gear (such as mounted weapons.) Whenever a Transformer would gain a new feat due to hit die, it may also change it's vehicle form, so long as the new vehicle is of the same size category as it's base form.

While in vehicle form they use all of the stats of the chosen vehicle form with the following exceptions: The Transformer keeps it's own hit points, class defense bonus to armor class, and treats the listed vehicle's hardness as Damage Reduction /-. A Transformer also retains any benefit from it's feats or class talents (such as a fast hero's increased speed or a tough hero's damage reduction.)

While in vehicle form the Transformer follows all rules for vehicle movement, maneuvers, and stunts. The Transformer is treated as it's own driver, but may relinquish (or regain) control to a passenger in the driver's position as a free action once per round.

Skill Bonuses: All Transformers gain a +5 species bonus to Drive and Pilot as well as a +2 bonus to Disguise and Bluff. A Transformer is naturally capable of maneuvering it's self and is can easily disguise it's self as a mundane vehicle.

Free Language Skills: Read/Write Cybertronian, Read/Write English.

Other Languages: Any

Temperature Damage: Transformers are vulnerable to temperature extremes. They obtain double damage from cold and hot-based attacks that reach -30 degrees and 500+ degrees, respectively (more accurately, liquid nitrogen and thermite).

Level Adjustment: By size.
Small & Medium: +2
Large: +3
Huge: +4
Gargantuan: +5
Colossal: +6



Think he's not a BakeNeko? Just wait 'till he grins at ya...

BAKENEKO


In Coreline, the term 'BakeNeko' is used for two different types of Fictions: actual humanoid cat-spirits who have entered the 'mortal realm' (but are different from, say, Geobreeder-verse Phantom Cats) and Fictions that were designed with extreme cat-like features (but aren't QUITE fully animalistic). Statistically, they are the same.
BakeNeko have an attitude and occasional mannerisms that are 'cat-like' (duh), and any number of cat-like features, such as ears, fangs, eyes and claws. They rarely see a need to disguise themselves.

RACIAL TRAITS:
*+2 Dexterity.
*30 ft. Base Speed.
*Jumpers: BakeNekos add 20 feet to their Jump check results (still have to roll normally, though).
*Low-Light Vision: The BakeNeko can see twice as far as normal in low-light conditions. The BakeNeko can still distinguish colors.
*Cat-Like Special Movement: BakeNekos take half damage (rounded down) from most falling and always land on their feet.
*Natural Weapons (Claws and Fangs): BakeNekos have highly developed fangs and sharp nails, which might not be lethal, but can be painful.
The claws give an additional 1d4 (Slashing) to melee attacks, while the fangs inflict (normal character melee damage +2, Piercing) damage.
A BakeNako who bites can maintain a biting grip, inflicting equivalent damage each round. These additional attacks are automatically succesful, but the opponent can break the hold with a succesful Strength check.
The BakeNeko cannot use weapons to defend himself while using the hold, and has a -4 penalty to evade any attack as well.

New Race: Eldar.
The story of the Eldar is one of regret and decline. Millennia ago, their race held the galaxy in their grasp. Their power was great; the Eldar could reshape entire worlds by the power of thought alone. Nothing threatened their dominance, and the Eldar began to lose themselves in the decadence of their comfortable existence.

However, their decadent indulgences exacted a terrible price. Unbeknownst to the Eldar, the energy from their depravity had caused increasing disturbances in the Warp. Eventually, these disturbances coallesced into a Chaos god who came to be known as Slaanesh. When Slaanesh was born, the energy from his birthcry travelled through the Warp and obliterated the minds of the majority of the Eldar race.

The few survivors, scattered on craftworlds on the edge of the galaxy, realised what had happened and committed themselves to avoiding the same fate. By devoting themselves to self-discipline, the remaining Eldar avoided the decadent follies of their brethren. Now, the Eldar fight to keep their ancient race from extinction.

Eldar (Humanoid) Species Traits

    * Size: Medium-size.
    * Ability Modifiers: +2 Dex,+2 Int -2 Cha. Eldar are fast and intuitive, but their thought processes are entirely alien from average humanoids.
    * Base Speed: 30 feet.
    * Naturally Psionic: All Eldar have some sense of the power their minds hold, as their entire race has opened their minds to the Warp. Eldar begin with 3 bonus power points at 1st level. This counts as the Wild Talent feat for the purposes of qualifying for advanced classes.
    * Telepathy: Eldar can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet who has a language.
    * Alien Mindset: Eldar have a touch of arrogance, partially understandable since some Eldar have lived longer than Humanity has had a written history. Eldar have a hard time relating to 'lesser' races and have a -4 penalty to Charisma based skills except with other Eldar. This penalty does not apply to the use of Psionic Powers which require a charisma based skill check.
    * Natural Language: Eldar

LA: --
The wall ahead of you shatters into so much dust as a giant, smiling, humanoid figure leaps through. The shining red liquid in his glass body shakes as lets out a bellowing, “Oh, yeaaahhh!”

It's not known how the Kool-Aid Man was created or whether there are more than one of him. What is known is that wherever fruity drinks of saturated sugar are served, he is there to help out, thanks to his discern location and greater teleport spell-like abilities. Wherever he goes, he enters in dramatic fashion, bursting through walls as though they were wet pasta and letting out a tremendous, “Oh, yeaaahhh!” Despite the mess he leaves, his ability to entertain is unparalleled, with his trademark smile and numerous performing talents. He's especially well-liked by children, and he's typically accompanied by a small troop of them soon after he arrives.

Combat
The Kool-Aid man never seeks out a fight, as he's a fun-loving guy who loves kids and sugar-laced drinks. However, when angered, he is terrifying in battle. His pyrex body grants him great durability, while his saturated sugar metabolism regenerates his wounds extremely quickly. His tremendous strength means that opponents are either bludgeoned to death or dropped bodily into his Kool-Aid filled body, whereby the acidic substance consumes them alive. Furthermore, thanks to his wall explosion and spell-like abilities, there is almost nowhere his enemies can run that he cannot find them.

Wall Explosion (Ex): The Kool-Aid Man receives a +20 competence bonus to burst open walls, so long as he yells out “Oh, yeaaahhh!” after doing so.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the Kool-Aid Man must hit with a slam attack. He can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If wins the grapple check, he establishes a hold and can try to submerge his enemy in the following round.

Submerge (Ex): The Kool-Aid man can submerge a grabbed opponent of Medium size or smaller by making a successful grapple check. A submerged creature is hurled into the Kool-Aid Man's sugar-filled body, whereby they must make a Fortitude save (DC 20) or be stunned for 1d6 rounds from the sugar rush. In addition, they take 2d6+10 points of acid damage per round while submerged. Creatures killed from this acid damage have their remains consumed one round later, as if by the destruction spell. Creatures that are submerged are still considered grappled while in the Kool-Aid Man's body, though he gets a -20 penalty on Grapple checks in this circumstance. If unstunned, they may attempt to escape submersion by breaking free of the Kool-Aid Man's grapple.

The Kool-Aid man can submerge one Medium, four Small, 16 Tiny, or 64 Diminutive or smaller creatures at one time.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will- air walk, discern location, greater teleport, jump. Caster level 20th.

Sugar Rush (Ex): By burning vast quantities of energy from his sugar-soaked metabolism, the Kool-Aid Man can move at terrifying speed. For up to ten rounds per day, he may function as though under the haste spell.

Vulnerable to Shatter (Ex): The Kool-Aid Man counts as a crystalline creature for the purposes of the shatter spell.

Skills: The Kool-Aid man has a +4 racial bonus on Perform (Dance) and Tumble checks.

Treasure
The Kool-Aid Man carries around virtually no possessions, leaving little conventional treasure for would-be thieves. However, the hundred gallons of Kool-Aid filling his frame is supernaturally potent. By withdrawing ten gallons of it from the Kool-Aid man's body, an individual skilled in alchemy can distill it into a thick, syrupy substance. This unholy mixture (sometimes referred to as "leet pwnage juice") can be concocted with a Craft (Alchemy) check (DC 25), requiring a period of one day and alchemical materials costing 100 gp. The alchemical materials are ruined in the process. If this substance is drunk, the drinker receives the benefits of the Kool-Aid Man's sugar rush ability for one hour. Afterwards, she immediately becomes fatigued (and often irritable) until she rests properly. The substance is worth roughly 1500 gp on the open market.

The Kool-Aid Man regenerates the Kool-Aid in his body automatically as long as he is alive. If destroyed, only the remaining volume of Kool-Aid in his body can be harvested.



I went back and gave Gojira's breath weapon a slight makeover and added a note that he is immune to radiation. After reading William Tsutsui's Godzilla on my Mind: 50 Years with the King of Monsters, I've gone an a whole kaiju kick. Expect many giant terrors filling the bestiary. Now that I have done the King, I guess the Evil Emperor and Queen are next up. First, we get the Evil Emperor, that ever-present figure of the Reaper from the Stars: King Ghidorah.

King Ghidorah-Death on the Wing
An ever-present beast in the shadows, a specter of the horrors of deep space, a dragon of the cosmos that never truly rests: all of these have been used to describe King Ghidorah. Speculated as potentially being even stronger than Gojira, King Ghidorah has never surfaced on Coreline Earth yet, but he has been infrequently reported as being glimpsed out of the corner of the eyes of Fictions from the Gundam, Star Wars, and Warhammer 40K universes. Most psychologists write these sightings off as a residual effect of King Ghidorah being seen as space's Grim Reaper, but in truth, the sightings are all too terrifyingly real. This grand beast is responsible for the complete obliteration of Soul Society's Outpost Raion near Tatooine, an event which caused fears amongst the Jedi Academy that Dark Lord of the Sith Lumiya had recreated a Death Star, despite the lack of any schematics and materials for her to do so. Ghidorah can create buffeting wing gusts, has twin smashing tails, and three heads that can blast lightning, not to mention the ability to survive in vacuum, fly, and potentially produce rudimentary psionics. Stronger, more powerful, more endurant...one must wonder the question of whether the Gojiras, battered and bruised from infighting and humanoid forces, can take on this beast when it finally does reach Coreline.

Any creature caught in the beam may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 King Ghidorah's HD + King Ghidorah's Constitution modifier) to half the damage.
Energy Resistance (Ex): King Ghidorah has fire and cold resistance 20.
Radiation Resistance (Ex): As a kaiju used to apocalyptic blazes of radiation, King Ghidorah gains a +8 species bonus to saves against radiation poisoning.
Vacuum Survival (Ex): King Ghidorah has an alien biology that seems to bypass the need for lungs, allowing him to live and move in the vacuum of space without any ill side-effects.
