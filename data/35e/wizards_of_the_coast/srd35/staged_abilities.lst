In this form, the elemental can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed. The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and up to 50 feet tall, depending on the elemental's size. The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet. The elemental's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the elemental moves into or through the creature's space. Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage when caught in the whirlwind (see the table below for details) and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the whirlwind's effects varies with the elemental's size (see the table). The save DC is Strength based.

This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.

This works just like an enlarge person or reduce person spell (the janni chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the janni. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect.

Gaze (Su)				KEY:Gaze ~ Ghaele	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:In humanoid form-slay evil creatures of 5 or less HD, range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates. Even if the save succeeds, the creature is affected as though by a fear spell for 2d10 rounds.

Light Ray (Ex)			KEY:Light Ray ~ Ghaele	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghaele in globe form can project light rays with a range of 300 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.
Alternate Form (Su)		KEY:Alternate Form ~ Ghaele	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghaele can shift between its humanoid and globe forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its light rays, but it can use its gaze attack and spell-like abilities, make physical attacks, and cast spells. In globe form, it can fly, use its light rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot cast spells or use its gaze attack. The globe form is incorporeal, and the ghaele has no Strength score while in that form. A ghaele remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the ghaele revert to any particular form when killed. A true seeing spell or ability, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.
Protective Aura (Su)		KEY:Protective Aura ~ Ghaele	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the ghaele.

# ~ Ghost
Corrupting Gaze (Su)		KEY:Corrupting Gaze ~ Ghost	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghost can blast living beings with a glance, at a range of up to 30 feet. Creatures that meet the ghost's gaze must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Charisma damage.
Corrupting Touch (Su)		KEY:Corrupting Touch ~ Ghost	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.
Draining Touch (Su)		KEY:Draining Touch ~ Ghost	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack rolls only. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.
Frightful Moan (Su)		KEY:Frightful Moan ~ Ghost	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghost can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic necromantic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost's moan for 24 hours.
Horrific Appearance (Su)	KEY:Horrific Appearance ~ Ghost	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Any living creature within 60 feet that views a ghost must succeed on a Fortitude save or immediately take 1d4 points of Strength damage, 1d4 points of Dexterity damage, and 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by the same ghost's horrific appearance for 24 hours.
Malevolence (Su)			KEY:Malevolence ~ Ghost	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per round, an ethereal ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the ghost's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be manifested and it must try move into the target's space; moving into the target's space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 15 + ghost's Cha modifier). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the target's space. If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the target's body.
Manifestation (Su)		KEY:Manifestation ~ Ghost	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells on the Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ghost can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested ghost always moves silently. A manifested ghost can strike with its touch attack or with a ghost touch weapon (see Ghostly Equipment, below). A manifested ghost remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is it not incorporeal. A manifested ghost can be attacked by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The ghost's incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane. When a spellcasting ghost is not manifested and is on the Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Material Plane, but they work normally against ethereal targets. When a spellcasting ghost manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely on touch. A manifested ghost's touch spells don't work on nonethereal targets. A ghost has two home planes, the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on either of these planes.
Telekinesis (Su)			KEY:Telekinesis ~ Ghost	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action (caster level 12th or equal to the ghost's HD, whichever is higher). When a ghost uses this power, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using it again.
Special Qualities			KEY:Special Qualities ~ Ghost	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghost has all the special qualities of the base creature as well as those described below.
Rejuvenation (Su)			KEY:Rejuvenation ~ Ghost	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: The "destroyed" spirit will often restore itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost's HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a ghost for sure is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research.
Turn Resistance (Ex)		KEY:Turn Resistance ~ Ghost	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghost has +4 turn resistance.

The save DC is Charisma-based. An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast, not a ghoul.
Paralysis (Ex)			KEY:Paralysis ~ Ghoul	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Those hit by a ghoul's bite or claw attack must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds.

Stench (Ex)				KEY:Stench ~ Ghast	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6+4 minutes. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same ghast's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.

Wounding (Ex)	KEY:Wounding ~ Bat Swarm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Any living creature damaged by a bat swarm continues to bleed, losing 1 hit point per round thereafter. Multiple wounds do not result in cumulative bleeding loss. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 10 Heal check or the application of a cure spell or some other healing magic.
Blindsense (Ex)	KEY:Blindsense ~ Bat Swarm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A bat swarm notices and locates creatures within 20 feet. Opponents still have total concealment against the bat swarm (but swarm attacks ignore concealment).

# ~ Hellwasp Swarm
Natural Weapons	KEY:Natural Weapons ~ Hellwasp Swarm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A hellwasp swarm's attack is treated as an evil-aligned weapon and a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Distraction (Ex)	KEY:Distraction ~ Hellwasp Swarm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Any living creature that begins its turn with a hellwasp swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Inhabit (Ex)	KEY:Inhabit ~ Hellwasp Swarm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A hellwasp swarm can enter the body of a helpless or dead creature by crawling into its mouth and other orifices. Inhabiting requires 1 minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large (although four swarms working together can  inhabit a Huge creature). The swarm can abandon the body at any time, although doing this takes 1 full round. Any attack against the host deals half damage to the hellwasp swarm as well, although the swarm's resistances and immunities may negate some or all of this damage. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it can restore animation to the creature and control its movements, effectively transforming it into a zombie of the appropriate size for as long as the swarm remains inside. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize the effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement and actions as if using dominate monster on the victim. The hellwasps quickly consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour they inhabit a body. A body reduced to Constitution 0 is dead. A hellwasp-inhabited creature is relatively easy to spot, since its skin crawls with the forms of insects inside. The swarm is intelligent enough to attempt to hide beneath loose clothing or a large cloak to keep its presence from being detected. The swarm can attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a host, with a -4 penalty if currently inhabiting a Small host. A remove disease or heal spell cast on an inhabited victim forces the hellwasp swarm to abandon its host.
Poison (Ex)		KEY:Poison ~ Hellwasp Swarm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Injury, Fortitude DC 18, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A rat swarm has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

Frightful Presence (Su)	KEY:Frightful Presence ~ Tarrasque	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The tarrasque can inspire terror by charging or attacking. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 36 Will save or become shaken, remaining in that condition as long as they remain with 60 feet of the tarrasque. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Improved Grab (Ex)	KEY:Improved Grab ~ Tarrasque	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:To use this ability, the tarrasque must hit a Huge or smaller opponent with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe the following round.
Rush (Ex)			KEY:Rush ~ Tarrasque	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per minute, the normally slow-moving tarrasque can move at a speed of 150 feet. 
Swallow Whole (Ex)	KEY:Swallow Whole ~ Tarrasque	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The tarrasque can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+8 points of crushing damage plus 2d8+6 points of acid damage per round from the tarrasque's digestive juices. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by dealing 50 points of damage to the tarrasque's digestive tract (AC 25). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. The tarrasque's gullet can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller creatures. 
Carapace (Ex)		KEY:Carapace ~ Tarrasque	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The tarrasque's armorlike carapace is exceptionally tough and highly reflective, deflecting all rays, lines, cones, and even magic missile spells.

Regeneration (Ex)		KEY:Regeneration ~ Tarrasque	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:No form of attack deals lethal damage to the tarrasque. The tarrasque regenerates even if it fails a saving throw against a disintegrate spell or a death effect. If the tarrasque fails its save against a spell or effect that would kill it instantly (such as those mentioned above), the spell or effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the creature's full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hp). The tarrasque is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, such as mummy rot, a sword with the wounding special ability, or a clay golem's cursed wound ability. The tarrasque can be slain only by raising its nonlethal damage total to its full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hit points) and using a wish or miracle spell to keep it dead. If the tarrasque loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes (the detached piece dies and decays normally). The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.
Skills			KEY:Skills ~ Tarrasque	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The tarrasque has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

# ~ Tendriculos
Improved Grab (Ex)		KEY:Improved Grab ~ Tendriculos	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:To use this ability, a tendriculos must hit a creature at least one size smaller than itself with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the opponent in the following round. A tendriculos can also use its improved grab ability on a tendril attack. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold, picks up the opponent, and transfers it to the mouth as a free action, automatically dealing bite damage.
Swallow Whole/Paralysis (Ex)	KEY:Swallow Whole/Paralysis ~ Tendriculos	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A tendriculos can try to swallow a grabbed opponent by making a successful grapple check. Once inside the plant's mass, the opponent must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds by the tendriculos's digestive juices, taking 2d6 points of acid damage per round. A new save is required each round inside the plant. The save DC is Constitution-based. A swallowed creature that avoids paralysis can climb out of the mass with a successful grapple check. This returns it to the plant's maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. A swallowed creature can also cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the tendriculos's interior (AC 14). Once the creature exits, the plant's regenerative capacity closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge tendriculos's interior can hold 2 Large, 8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller opponents. 
Regeneration (Ex)			KEY:Regeneration ~ Tendriculos	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Bludgeoning weapons and acid deal normal damage to a tendriculos.

# ~ Tojanida
Improved Grab (Ex)	KEY:Improved Grab ~ Tojanida	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:To use this ability, a tojanida must hit with a bite or claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Underwater, a tojanida can tow a grabbed victim of its own size or smaller at its swim speed (but it cannot run). A favorite tactic is to grab a single opponent, then withdraw, hauling the opponent away from its allies.
Ink Cloud (Ex)		KEY:Ink Cloud ~ Tojanida	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A tojanida can emit a spherical cloud of jet-black ink with a radius of 30 feet once per minute as a free action. The effect is otherwise similar to fog cloud cast by an individual of a level equal to the tojanida's Hit Dice. Out of water, the ink emerges in a stream up to 30 feet long, which a tojanida can squirt into an opponent's eyes. The affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round.

# ~ Treant
Animate Trees (Sp)			KEY:Animate Trees ~ Treant	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A treant can animate trees within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant in all respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the treant that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise similar to liveoak (caster level 12th). Animated trees have the same vulnerability to fire that a treant has.

All living creatures (except troglodytes) within 30 feet of a troglodyte must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for 10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same troglodyte's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.
Skills	KEY:Skills ~ Troglodyte	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The skin of a troglodyte changes color somewhat, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings like a chameleon and providing a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. *In rocky or underground settings, this bonus improves to +8.

# ~ Troll

Children of the Night (Su)	KEY:Children of the Night ~ VAMPIRE TEMPLATE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world and once per day can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.
Dominate (Su)			KEY:Dominate ~ VAMPIRE TEMPLATE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampire can crush an opponent's will just by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the vampire must use a standard action, and those merely looking at it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire's influence as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet.
Create Spawn (Su)			KEY:Create Spawn ~ VAMPIRE TEMPLATE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by a vampire's energy drain rises as a vampire spawn (see the Vampire Spawn entry) 1d4 days after burial.  If the vampire instead drains the victim's Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or less HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is under the command of the vampire that created it and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. At any given time a vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit are created as free-willed vampires or vampire spawn. A vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of lesser vampires in this fashion. A vampire may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.
Energy Drain (Su)			KEY:Energy Drain ~ VAMPIRE TEMPLATE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Living creatures hit by a vampire's slam attack (or any other natural weapon the vampire might possess) gain two negative levels.

Alternate Form (Su)		KEY:Alternate Form ~ VAMPIRE TEMPLATE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampire can assume the shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. This ability is similar to a polymorph spell cast by a 12th-level character, except that the vampire does not regain hit points for changing form and must choose from among the forms mentioned here. While in its alternate form, the vampire loses its natural slam attack and dominate ability, but it gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of its new form. It can remain in that form until it assumes another or until the next sunrise. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might allow other forms.)
Damage Reduction (Su)		KEY:Damage Reduction ~ VAMPIRE TEMPLATE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampire has damage reduction 10/silver and magic. A vampire's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Fast Healing (Ex)			KEY:Fast Healing ~ VAMPIRE TEMPLATE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampire heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Any additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in its coffin, a vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.
Gaseous Form (Su)			KEY:Gaseous Form ~ VAMPIRE TEMPLATE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
Resistances (Ex)			KEY:Resistances ~ VAMPIRE TEMPLATE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampire has resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10.
Spider Climb (Ex)			KEY:Spider Climb ~ VAMPIRE TEMPLATE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though with a spider climb spell.
Turn Resistance (Ex)		KEY:Turn Resistance ~ VAMPIRE TEMPLATE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampire has +4 turn resistance.
Vampire Weaknesses		KEY:Vampire Weaknesses ~ VAMPIRE TEMPLATE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses.	DESC:&nl; Repelling a Vampire: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These things don't harm the vampire-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature holding the item for the rest of the encounter. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action.	DESC:&nl; Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard a ship.	DESC:&nl; They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. They may freely enter public places, since these are by definition open to all. 	DESC:&nl; Slaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see the note on fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can take only a single move action or attack action and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water robs it of one-third of its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion. Driving a wooden stake through a vampire's heart instantly slays the monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the body is destroyed. A popular tactic is to cut off the creature's head and fill its mouth with holy wafers (or their equivalent).

If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Once at rest in its coffin, it is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 2 hit points per round.
Gaseous Form (Su)		KEY:Gaseous Form ~ Vampire Spawn	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a standard action, a vampire spawn can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level 6th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
Spider Climb (Ex)		KEY:Spider Climb ~ Vampire Spawn	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces as though with a spider climb spell.
Skills			KEY:Skills ~ Vampire Spawn	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Vampire spawn have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks.
Vampire Weaknesses	KEY:Vampire Weaknesses ~ Vampire Spawn	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses.	DESC:&nl; Repelling a Vampire: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These things don't harm the vampire-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature holding the item for the rest of the encounter. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action.	DESC:&nl; Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard a ship.	DESC:&nl; They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. They may freely enter public places, since these are by definition open to all.	DESC:&nl; Slaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see the note on fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can take only a single move action or attack action and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water robs it of one-third of its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion. Driving a wooden stake through a vampire's heart instantly slays the monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the body is destroyed. A popular tactic is to cut off the creature's head and fill its mouth with holy wafers (or their equivalent).

# ~ Vargouille
Natural Weapons	KEY:Natural Weapons ~ Vargouille	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vargouille's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Shriek (Su)		KEY:Shriek ~ Vargouille	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its distended mouth and let out a terrible shriek. Those within 60 feet (except other vargouilles) who hear the shriek and can clearly see the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed with fear for 2d4 rounds or until the monster attacks them, goes out of range, or leaves their sight. A paralyzed creature is susceptible to the vargouille's kiss (see below). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same vargouille's shriek for 24 hours. The shriek is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
Kiss (Su)		KEY:Kiss ~ Vargouille	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vargouille can kiss a paralyzed target with a successful melee touch attack. An affected opponent must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or begin a terrible transformation that turns the creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often much sooner; roll 1d6 separately for each phase of the transformation). First, over a period of 1d6 hours, all the victim's hair falls out. Within another 1d6 hours thereafter, the ears grow into leathery wings, tentacles sprout on the chin and scalp, and the teeth become long, pointed fangs. During the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes Intelligence drain and Charisma drain equal to 1 point per hour (to a minimum of 3). The transformation is complete 1d6 hours later, when the head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies) and becomes a vargouille. This transformation is interrupted by sunlight, and even a daylight spell can delay death, but to reverse the transformation requires remove disease. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
Poison (Ex)		KEY:Poison ~ Vargouille	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Injury, Fortitude DC 12 or be unable to heal the vargouille's bite damage naturally or magically.
